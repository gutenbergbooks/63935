<h1>THE COUNTERPLOT</h1>

<p>Miss Hope Mirrlees, when she wrote <i>Madeleine</i>,
several years ago, was recognised to be one of the
most promising of the younger school of women
novelists.</p>

<p><i>The Counterplot</i> is a study of the literary temperament.
Teresa Lane, watching the slow movement
of life manifesting itself in the changing
inter-relations of her family, is teased by the
complexity of the spectacle, and comes to realise
that her mind will never know peace till, by
transposing the problem into art, she has reduced
it to its permanent essential factors. So, from
the texture of the words, the emotions, the interactions
of the life going on around her she weaves
a play, the setting of which is a Spanish convent
in the fourteenth century, and this play performs
for her the function that Freud ascribes to dreams,
for by it she is enabled to express subconscious
desires, to vent repressed irritation, to say things
that she is too proud and civilised ever to have
said in any other way. This brief summary can give
but little idea of the charm of style, the subtlety
of characterisation, and the powerful intelligence
which Miss Hope Mirrlees reveals. The play itself
is a most brilliant, imaginative <i>tour de force</i>!</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Plasencia was a square, medium-sized house of red
brick, built some sixty years ago, in those days when
architects knew a great deal about comfort, but cared
so little about line that every house they designed,
however spacious, was uncompromisingly a “villa.”
Viewed from the front, it was substantial and home-like,
and suggested, even in the height of summer, a “merry
Christmas” and fire-light glinting off the leaves of
holly; from the back, however, it had a look of instability,
of somehow being not firmly rooted in the
earth—a cumbersome Ark, awkwardly perched for a
moment on Ararat, before plunging with its painted
wooden crew into the flood, and sailing off to some
fantastic port.</p>

<p>It is possible that this effect was not wholly due to the
indifferent draughtsmanship of the Victorian architect,
for there is a hint of the sea in a delicate and boundless
view, and the back of Plasencia lay open to the Eastern
counties.</p>

<p>Even the shadowy reticulation of a West-country
valley, the spring bloom upon fields and woods, and
red-brick villas that glorifies the tameness of Kent,
are but poor things in comparison with the Eastern
counties in September: yellow stripes of mustard,
jade stripes of cabbage, stripes of old rose which is the
earth, a suggestion of pattern given by the heaps of
manure, and the innumerable shocks of corn, an ardent
gravity given by the red-brown of wheat stubble,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
such as the red-brown sails of a fishing boat give to
the milky-blue of a summer sea; here and there a
patch of green tarpaulin, and groups of thatched corn-ricks—shadowy,
abstract, golden, and yet, withal,
homely edifices, like the cottages of those villages of
Paradise whose smoke Herrick used to see in the
distance. An agricultural country has this advantage
over heaths and commons and pastoral land that the
seasons walk across it <i>visibly</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">On a particular afternoon in September, about three
years ago, Teresa Lane sat in a deck-chair gazing at
this view. She was a pallid, long-limbed young woman
of twenty-eight, and her dark, closely-cropped hair
emphasised her resemblance to that lad who, whether
he be unfurling a map of Toledo, or assisting at the
mysterious obsequies of the Conde de Orgas, is continually
appearing in the pictures of El Greco.</p>

<p>As she gazed, she thought of the Spanish adjective
<i>pintado</i>, painted, which the Spaniards use for anything
that is bright and lovely—flowers, views; and certainly
this view was <i>pintado</i>, even in the English sense, in
that it looked like a fresco painted on a vast white
wall, motionless and enchanted against the restless,
vibrating foreground. Winds from the Ural
mountains, winds from the Atlantic celebrated Walpurgis-night
on the lawn of Plasencia; and, on such
occasions, to look through the riven garden, the swaying
flowers and grasses, the tossing birch saplings, at
the tranced fields of the view was to experience the
same æsthetic emotion as when one looks at the picture
of a great painter.</p>

<p>But the back of Plasencia had another glory—its
superb herbaceous border, which, waving banners of
the same hues, only brighter, marched boldly into the
view, and became one with it. Now in September<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
it was stiffened by annuals: dahlias, astors, snapdragon,
sunflowers; Californian poppies whose whiteness—at
any rate in the red poppyland of East
Anglia—always seems exotic, miraculous, suggesting
the paradoxical chemical action of the Blood of the
Lamb. There were also great clumps of violas, with
petals of so faint a shade of blue or yellow that every
line of their black tracery stood out clear and distinct,
and which might have been the handiwork of
some delicate-minded and deft-fingered old maid,
expressing her dreams and heart’s ease in a Cathedral
city a hundred years ago. As to herbaceous things
proper, there was St. John’s wort, catmint, borrage,
sage; their stalks grown so long and thick, their
blossoms so big and brave, that old Gerard would
have been hard put to see in them his familiars—the
herbs that, like guardian angels, drew down from
the stars the virtue for the homely offices of easing the
plough-boy’s toothache, the beldame’s ague.</p>

<p>A great lawn spread between the border and the
house; it was still very threadbare owing to the
patriotic pasturage that, during the last years of the
War, it had afforded to half a dozen sheep, but it was
darned in so many places by the rich, dark silk of
clover leaves as almost to be turned into a new fabric.</p>

<p>Well, then, the view and border lay simmering in
the late sunshine. A horse was dragging a plough
against the sky-line, and here and there thin streams of
smoke were rising from heaps of smouldering weeds.
In the nearer fields, Teresa could discern small, moving
objects of a dazzling whiteness—white leghorns gleaning
the stubble; and from time to time there reached her
the noise of a distant shot, heralding a supper of roast
hare or partridge in some secluded farm-house. Then,
like a Danish vessel bound for pillage in Mercia, white,
swift, compact, a flock of wood pigeons would flash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
through the air to alight in a far away field and rifle
the corn.</p>

<p>But so <i>pintado</i> was the view, so under the notion of
art, that these movements across its surface gave one
an æsthetic shock such as one would experience before
a mechanical device introduced into a painting, and,
at the same time, thrilled the imagination, as if the
door in a picture should suddenly open, or silver strains
proceed from the painted shepherd’s pipe.</p>

<p>Teresa could hardly be said to take a pleasure in the
view and its flowery foreground—indeed, like all lovely
and complicated things, they teased her exceedingly;
because the infinite variety which made up their whole
defied expression. Until the invention of some machine,
she was thinking, shows to literature what are its
natural limits (as the camera and cinema have shown
to painting) by expressing, in some unknown medium,
say a spring wood <i>in toto</i>—appearance, smells, noises,
associations—which will far outstrip in exact representation
the combined qualities of Mozart, Spencer,
Corot, Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and yet remain dead and
flat and vulgar,—so long shall we be teased by the
importunities of detail and forget that such things as
spring woods are best expressed lightly, delicately, in
a little song, thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The grove are all a pale, frail mist,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The new year sucks the sun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all the kisses that we kissed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now which shall be the one?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As she murmured the lines below her breath, two
children came running down the grass path that divided
the herbaceous border—Anna and Jasper Sinclair, the
grandchildren of the house.</p>

<p>Teresa watched their progress, critically, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
half-closed lids. Yes, children are the right <i>fauna</i>
for a garden—they turn it at once into a world that is
miniature and Japanese. But perhaps a kitten prowling
among flower-beds is better still—it is so amusing to
watch man’s decorous arrangement of nature turning,
under the gambols of the sinister little creature, into
something primitive and tropical—bush, or jungle, or
whatever they call it in Brazil and places; but Anna
was getting too big.</p>

<p>Human beings too! Worse than the view, because
more restless and more complicated, yet insisting on
being dealt with; even Shelley could not keep out of
his garden his somewhat Della Cruscan Lady.</p>

<p>The children came running up to her.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what <i>we’ve</i> found, what <i>we’ve</i>
found, what <i>we’ve</i> found!” “Let <i>me</i> say! a <i>dead</i>
hare, and we’ve buried him and....” “And I’ve
found a new fern; I’ve got ten and a half kinds now
and I ought to get a Girl Guide’s badge for them, and
the Doña <i>promised</i> me some more blotting-paper,
but....”</p>

<p>Teresa stroked Jasper’s sticky little hand and listened
indulgently to their chatter. Then they caught sight of
Mrs. Lane coming out of the house, and rushed at her,
shouting, “Doña! Doña!”</p>

<p>The Spaniards deal in a cavalier way with symbolism;
for instance, they put together from the markets, and
streets, and balconies of Andalusia a very human
type of female loveliness; next, they express this
type with uncompromising realism in painted wooden
figures which they set up in churches, saying, “This
is not Pepa, or Ana, or Carmen. Oh, no! It isn’t a
woman at all: it’s a mysterious abstract doctrine of
the Church called the Immaculate Conception.” They
then proceed to fall physically in love with this abstract
doctrine—serenading it with lyrics, organising pageants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
in its honour, running their swords through those who
deny its truth, storming the Vatican for its acceptance.</p>

<p>Hence, for those who are acquainted with Spain, it
is hard to look on Spanish concrete things with a perfectly
steady eye—they are apt to become transparent
without losing their solidity.</p>

<p>However this may be, Mrs. Lane (the Doña, as her
friends and family called her), standing there smiling
and monumental, with the children clinging to her
skirts, seemed to Teresa a symbol—of what she was not
quite sure. Maternity? No, not exactly; but it
was something connected with maternity.</p>

<p>The children, having said their say, made for the
harbour of their own little town—to wit, the nursery—where,
over buns, and honey, and chocolate cake, they
would tell their traveller’s tales; and the Doña bore
down slowly upon Teresa and sank heavily into a
basket chair. She raised her <i>lorgnette</i> and gazed at
her daughter critically.</p>

<p>“Teresa,” she said, in her slow, rather guttural
voice, “why do you so love that old skirt? But I
warn you, it is going to the very next jumble sale of
Mrs. Moore.”</p>

<p>Teresa smiled quite amicably.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you let Concha’s elegance do for us
both?” she asked.</p>

<p>So toneless and muted was Teresa’s voice that it was
generally impossible to deduce from it, as also from her
rather weary impassive face, of what emotion her
remarks were the expression.</p>

<p>“Rubbish! There is no reason why I shouldn’t
have <i>two</i> elegant daughters,” retorted the Doña, wondering
the while why exactly Teresa was jealous of Concha.
“It <i>must</i> be a man; but who?” she asked herself.
Aloud she said, “I wonder why tea is so late. By the
way, I told you, didn’t I, that Arnold is coming for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
week-end and bringing Guy? And some young
cousin of Guy’s—I think he said his name was Dundas.”</p>

<p>“I know—Rory Dundas. Guy often talks about
him. He’s a soldier, so he’ll probably be even more
tiresome than Guy.”</p>

<p>Oho! How, exactly, was this to be interpreted?</p>

<p>“Why, Teresa, a nice young officer, with beautiful
blue eyes like Guy perhaps, only not slouching like
Cambridge men, and you think that he will be <i>tiresome</i>!”</p>

<p>Again Teresa smiled amicably, and wished for the
thousandth time that her mother would sometimes stop
being ironical—or, at any rate, that her irony had a
different flavour.</p>

<p>“And so Guy is tiresome too, is he?”</p>

<p>Teresa laughed. “No one shows more that they
think so than you, Doña.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but I think <i>all</i> Englishmen tiresome.”</p>

<p>Then the butler and parlour-maid appeared with tea;
and a few minutes later Concha, the other daughter,
strolled up, her arm round the waist of a small, elderly
lady.</p>

<p>Concha was a very beautiful girl of twenty-two. She
was tall, and built delicately on a generous scale; her
hair was that variety of auburn which, when found
among women of the Latin races, never fails to give
a thrill of unexpectedness, and a whiff of romance—hinting
at old old rapes by Normans and Danes.
As one looked at her one realised what a beautiful
creature the Doña must once have been.</p>

<p>The elderly lady was governess <i>emerita</i> of the
Lanes. They had grown so attached to her that she
had stayed on as “odd woman”—arranging the
flowers, superintending the servants, going up to
London at the sales to shop for the family. They
called her “Jollypot,” because “jolly” was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
adjective with which she qualified anything beautiful,
kindly, picturesque, or quaint; “pot” was added as
the essence of the æsthetic aspect of “jolliness,”
typified in the activities of Arts and Crafts and Artificers’
Guilds—indeed she always, and never more than to-day,
looked as if she had been dressed by one of these institutions;
on her head was a hat of purple and green
straw with a Paisley scarf twisted round the crown,
round her shoulders was another scarf—handwoven,
gray and purple—on her torso was an orange jumper
into which were inserted squares of canvas wool-work
done by a Belgian refugee with leanings to Cubism;
and beads,—enormous, painted wooden ones. Once
Harry Sinclair (the father of Anna and Jasper) had
exploded a silence with the question, “Why is Jollypot
like the Old Lady of Leeds? Because she’s ...
er ... er ... INFESTED WITH BEADS!!!”</p>

<p>While on this subject let me add that it was
characteristic of her relationship with her former
pupils that they called her Jollypot to her face, and
that she had never taken the trouble to find out
why; that the great adventure of her life had been
her conversion to Catholicism—a Catholicism, however,
which retained a tinge of Anglicanism: to wit,
a great deal of vague enthusiasm for “dear, lovely
St. Francis of Assisi,” combined with a neglect of the
crude and truly Catholic cult of that most potent of
“medicine-men”—St. Anthony of Padua; and that
taste for Dante studies so characteristic of middle-aged
Anglican spinsters. Indeed, she was remarkably
indiscriminating in her tastes, and loved equally Shakespeare,
Dante, Mrs. Browning, the Psalms, Anne
Thackeray, and W. J. Locke; but from time to time
she surprised one by the poetry and truth of her
observations.</p>

<p>The Doña, holding in mid-air a finger biscuit soaked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
in chocolate, smiled and blinked a welcome; but her
eyes flashed to her brain the irritated message, “If
only the jumper were purple, or even green! And those
beads—does she sleep in them?”</p>

<p>Partly from a Latin woman’s exaggerated sense of
the ridiculous possibilities in raiment, partly from an
Andalusian <i>Schaden-freude</i>, ever since she had known
Jollypot she had tried to persuade her that a devout
Catholic should dress mainly in black; but Jollypot
would flush with indignation and cry, “Oh! Mrs.
Lane, how <i>can</i> you? When God has given us all these
<i>jolly</i> colours! Just look at your own garden! I
remember a dear old lady when I was a girl who used
to say she didn’t see why we should say grace for <i>food</i>
because that was a necessity and God was <i>bound</i> to
give it to us, but that we should say it for the <i>luxuries</i>—flowers
and colours—that it was so good and <i>fatherly</i>
of Him to think of.” Which silly, fanciful Protestantism
would put the Doña into a frenzy of
irritation.</p>

<p>But Jollypot—secure in her knowledge of her own
consideration of the Sesame and Lilies of the field—had,
as usual, a pleasant sense of being prettily dressed,
and, quite unaware that she offended, she sat down to
her tea with a little sigh of innocent pleasure. Concha,
after having hugged the unresponsive Doña, and
affectionately inquired after Teresa’s headache, wearily
examined the contents of the tea-table, and having
taken a small piece of bread and butter, muttered that
she wished Rendall would cut it thinner.</p>

<p>“And what have you been doing this afternoon?”
asked the Doña.</p>

<p>“At the Moore’s,” answered Concha, a little sulkily.</p>

<p>“But how very kind of you! That poor Mrs.
Moore must have been quite touched ... did I hear
that Eben was home on leave?” and the Doña<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
scrutinised her with lazy amusement; Teresa, also,
looked at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s back,” said Concha, lightly, but
blushing crimson all the same. She loathed being
teased. “How incredibly Victorian and Spanish it
all is!” she thought.</p>

<p>She yawned, then poured some tea and cream into
a saucer, added two lumps of sugar, and put it down
on the lawn for the refreshment of ’Snice, the dachshund.</p>

<p>“And how was Eben?” asked the Doña.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was in <i>great</i> form—really <i>extraordinarily</i>
funny about getting drunk at Gibraltar,” drawled
Concha; she always drawled when she was angry,
embarrassed, or “feeling grand.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the English always get drunk at Gibraltar—it
wasn’t at all original of Eben.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” and again Concha yawned.</p>

<p>“And I suppose Mrs. Moore said, ‘Ebenebeneben!
Prenny guard!’ which meant that one of the Sunday
school children was coming up the path and he must
be careful what he said.”</p>

<p>Concha gurgled with laughter—pleasantly, like a
child being tickled—at the Doña’s mimicry; and the
atmosphere cleared.</p>

<p>Teresa remembered Guy Cust’s once saying that
conversation among members of one family was a
most uncomfortable thing. When one asks questions it
is not for information (one knows the answers already)
but to annoy. It is, he had said, as if four or five men,
stranded for years on a desert island with a pack of
cards, had got into the habit of playing poker all day
long, and that, though the game has lost all savour
and all possibilities of surprise; for each knowing so
well the “play” of the other, no bluff ever succeeds,
and however impassive their opponent’s features, they
can each immediately, by the sixth sense of intimacy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
distinguish the smell of a “full house,” or a “straight,”
from that of a “pair.”</p>

<p>For instance, the Doña and Teresa knew quite well
where Concha had been that afternoon; and Concha
had known that they would know and pretend that
they did not, so she had arrived irritated in
advance, and the Doña and Teresa had watched her
approach, maliciously amused in advance.</p>

<p>“Well, and was Mrs. Moore hinting again that she
would like to have her Women’s Institute in my garden?”
asked the Doña.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and she wants Teresa to go down to the
Institute one night and talk to them about Seville, but
I was quite firm and said I was sure nothing would
induce her.”</p>

<p>“You were wrong,” said Teresa, in an even voice,
“I should like to talk to them about Seville.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” muttered Concha.</p>

<p>“Give them a description of a bull-fight, Teresa. It
would amuse me to watch the face of Mrs. Moore and
the Vicar,” said the Doña.</p>

<p>Teresa and Concha laughed, and Jollypot shuddered,
muttering, “Those poor horses!”</p>

<p>The Doña looked at her severely. “Well, Jollypot
and what about the poor foxes and hares in England?”</p>

<p>This amœbæan dirge was one often chanted by the
Doña and Jollypot.</p>

<p>“Oh! look at the birds’ orchard ... all red with
haws. Poor little fellows! They’ll have a good
harvest,” cried Jollypot, pointing to the double hedge
of hawthorn that led to the garage, and evidently glad
to turn from man’s massacring of beasts to God’s
catering for birds.</p>

<p>“Seville!” said Concha meditatively; and a silence
fell upon them while the word went rummaging among
the memories of the mother and her daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Tittering with one’s friends behind one’s <i>reja</i>, while
Mr. Lane down below (though then only twenty-three,
already stout and intensely prosaic), self-consciously
sang a Spanish serenade with an execrable
English accent; gipsy girls hawking lottery tickets
in the <i>Sierpes</i>; eating ices in the <i>Pasaje del Oriente</i>;
the ladies in mantillas laughing shrilly at the queer
English hats and clumsy shoes; the wall of the Alcazar
patined with jessamine; long noisy evenings (rather
like poems by Campoamor), of cards and acrostics and
flirtation; roses growing round orange trees; exquisite
horsemanship; snub-nosed, ill-shaven men
looking with laughing eyes under one’s hat, and crying,
<i>Viva tu madre!</i> Dark, winding, high-walled streets,
called after Pedro the Cruel’s Jewish concubines; one’s
milk and vegetables brought by donkeys, stepping as
delicately as Queen Guinevere’s mule. One by one the
candles of the <i>Tenebrario</i> extinguished to the moan
of the <i>miserere</i>, till only the waxen thirteenth remains
burning; goats, dozens of wooden Virgins in stiff brocade,
every one of them <i>sin pecado concebida</i>, city of goats
and Virgins ... yes, that’s it—city of goats and
Virgins.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Concha nonchalantly, “I’ve
asked Eben to lunch on Sunday.”</p>

<p>The Doña bowed ironically and Concha blushed,
and calling ’Snice got up and moved majestically
towards the house.</p>

<p>“Arnold’s coming on Saturday, Jollypot,” said the
Doña, triumphantly.</p>

<p>“The dear fellow! That <i>is</i> jolly,” said Jollypot;
then sharply drew in her breath, as if suddenly remembering
something, and, with a worried expression,
hurried away.</p>

<p>The thing she had suddenly remembered was that
the billiard-table was at that moment strewn with rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
petals drying upon blotting-paper, and that Arnold
would be furious if they were not removed before his
arrival.</p>

<p>The Doña, by means of a quizzical look at Teresa,
commented upon the last quarter of an hour, but
Teresa’s expression was not responsive.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Doña, regretfully hoisting her bulk
from her basket-chair, “I must go and catch Rudge
before he goes home and tell him to keep the sweet
corn for Saturday—Arnold’s so fond of it. And
there’s the border to be—oh, your father and his
golf!”</p>

<p>The irritated tone of this exclamation ended on the
last word in a note of scorn.</p>

<p class="tb">Teresa sat on alone by the deserted tea-table, idly
watching the Doña standing by the border, in earnest
talk with the gardener.</p>

<p>How comely and distinguished, and how beautifully
modelled the Doña looked in the westering light!
No one could model like late sunshine—she had seen it
filtering through the leaves of a little wood and
turning the smooth, gray trunk of a beech into an
exquisite clay torso, not yet quite dry, fresh from the
plastic thumb, faithfully maintaining the delusion
that, though itself a pliable substance, the frame over
which it was stretched was rigid and bony. The Doña
and beech trees, however, were beautiful, even without
the evening light; but she had also seen the portion
of a rain-pipe that juts out at right angles from the
wall before taking its long and graceless descent—she
had seen the evening light turn its dirty yellow into
creamy flesh-tints, its contour into the bent knee of a
young Diana.</p>

<p>Forces that made things <i>look</i> beautiful were certainly
part of a “Merciful Dispensation.” Memory was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
one of these forces. How exquisite, probably, life at
Plasencia would look some day!</p>

<p>It would take a lot of mellowing, she thought, with
a little smile. Again it was a question of the swarm
of tiny details: beauty, evidently, requiring their
elimination.</p>

<p>But, for instance, the interplay of emotions at tea
that afternoon—was it woven from the tiny brittle
threads of unimportant details, or was it made of a
more resisting stuff?</p>

<p>Why was the Doña equally irritated that she, Teresa,
ignored young men, and that Concha ran after them—like
a tabby-cat in perpetual season? No—that
was disgusting, coarse, unkind. There was nothing
ugly about Concha’s abundant youth: she was
merely normal—following the laws of life, no more
disgusting than a ripe apple ready to drop.</p>

<p>There came into Teresa’s head the beginning of one
of Cervantes’s <i>Novelas Exemplares</i>, which tells of the
impulse that drives young men, although they may
love their parents dearly, to break away from their
home and wander across the world, “... nor can
meagre fare and poor lodging cause them to miss the
abundance of their father’s house; nor does travelling
on foot weary them, nor cold torment them, nor heat
exhaust them.”</p>

<p>And, added Teresa, rich in the wisdom of a myriad
songs and stories, they are probably fully aware, ere
they shut behind them the door of their home, that
some day they, too, will discover that freedom is nought
but a lonely wind, howling for the past.</p>

<p><i>Il n’y a pour l’homme que trois événements: naître,
vivre et mourir</i> ... yes, but to realise that, personally,
emotionally—to feel <i>as one</i> the three events—three
simultaneous things making one thing that is perpetually
repeated, three notes in a chord—and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
chord Life itself ... an agonising sense of speed ...
yes, the old simile of the rushing river that carries one—where?
But every life, or group of lives, is deaf to
the chord, stands safe on the bank of the river, till a
definite significant moment, which, looked back upon,
seems to have announced its arrival with an actual
noise—a knocking, or a rumbling. To Teresa, it
seemed that that moment for them all at Plasencia
had been Pepa’s death, two years ago—<i>that</i> had been
what had plunged them into the river. Before, all of
them (the Doña too) had lived in Eternity. Now, when
Teresa awoke in the night, the minutes dripped, one by
one, on to the same nerve, till the agony became almost
unbearable; and it was the agony of listening to a tale
which the narrator cannot gabble fast enough, because
you know the end beforehand—yes, something which is
at once a ball all tightly rolled up that you hold in your
hand and a ball which you are slowly unwinding.</p>

<p>She looked towards the house—the old ark that had
so long stood high and dry; now, it seemed to her, the
water had reached the windows of the lowest story—soon
it would be afloat, carrying them all ... no, not
her father. He, she was sure, was still—would always
be—outside of Time.</p>

<p>But Concha—Concha was there as much as she
herself.</p>

<p>Why did she mind in Concha the same intellectual
insincerities and pretensions, the same airs and graces,
that she had loved in Pepa?</p>

<p>She smiled tenderly as she remembered how once
at school she had opened Pepa’s <i>Oxford Book of English
Verse</i> at the fly-leaf and found on it, in a “leggy,”
unfledged hand, the following inscription: “To Josepha
Lane, from her father,” and underneath, an extract
from Cicero’s famous period in praise of letters—<i>et
haec studia adulescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and so on. (That term Pepa’s form had been reading
the <i>Pro Archia</i>.)</p>

<p>Teresa had gone to her and asked her what it meant.</p>

<p>“Dad would <i>never</i> have written that—besides, it’s
in your writing.”</p>

<p>Pepa had blushed, and then laughed, and said, “Well,
you see I wanted Ursula Noble” (Ursula Noble’s father
was a celebrated Hellenist) “to think that <i>we</i> had a
brainy father too!”</p>

<p>Then, how bustling and important she had been when,
shorty after her <i>début</i>, she had become engaged to
Harry Sinclair—a brilliant Trinity Don, much older
than herself, and already an eminent Mendelian—how
quickly and superficially she had taken over all his
views—liberalism, atheism, eugenics!</p>

<p>Oh, yes, there had been much that had been irritating
in Pepa; but, though Teresa had recognised it mentally,
she had never felt it in her nerves.</p>

<p>She was suddenly seized with a craving for Pepa’s
presence—dear, innocent, complacent Pepa, so lovely,
so loving, with her fantastic, yet, somehow or other,
cheering plans for one’s pleasure or well-being—plans
that she galvanised with her own generous vitality.</p>

<p>Yes, Pepa had certainly been very happy during her
six or seven years of married life at Cambridge: cultured
undergraduates pouring into tea on Sundays, and Pepa
taking them as seriously as they took themselves,
laughing delightedly at the latest epigram that was
going the round of Trinity and Kings’—“Dogs are
sentimental,” or “Shaw is so Edwardian”—trolling
<i>Spanish Ladies</i> or the <i>Morning Dew</i> in chorus round
the piano; footing it on the lawn—undergraduates,
Newnham students, Cambridge matrons, young dons,
eyeglasses and prominent teeth glittering in the sun,
either a slightly patronising smile glued on the face, or
an expression of strenuous endeavour—to the favourite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
melodies of Charles II.; suffrage meetings without end,
lectures on English literature, practising glees in the
Choral Society; busy making cardboard armour for
the Greek play, or bicycling off to Grantchester, or
taking Anna to her dancing class, or off to Boots to
change her novels—a Galsworthy for herself, a Phillips
Oppenheim for Harry.</p>

<p>It had always seemed to Teresa that this life, in spite
of its suffrage and girl’s clubs and “culture,” was both
callous and frivolous in comparison with the tremendous
adventures that were going on, all round, in laboratories
and studies and College rooms: at any moment Professor
—— might be able to resolve an atom, and blow
up the whole of Cambridge in the process; and, in
little plots of ground, flowers whose <i>habitat</i> was Peru
or the Himalayas, were springing up with—say, purple
pollen instead of golden, and that meant that a new
species had been born; or else, Mr. —— of Christ’s, or
John’s, or Caius, would suddenly feel the blood rush to
his head as a blinding light was thrown on the verbal
nouns of classical Arabic by a French article he had
just been reading on the use of diminutives in the
harems of Morocco.</p>

<p>Anyhow, whether callous or frivolous or both, it had
given Pepa seven happy years.</p>

<p>What Harry Sinclair’s contribution—apart from the
necessary background—had been to that happiness it
would, perhaps, be difficult to determine. There
could be no one in the world less sympathetic to the
small emotional things—so important in married life—than
Harry: homesickness, imagined slights when one
was tired, fears that one’s son aged three summers
might some twenty years ahead fall in love with little
Angela Webb, and there was consumption in the
family—he viewed them with the impatience of a young
lady before the furniture of a drawing-room that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
wants to clear for a dance, the dance, in his case, being
the sweeps, pirouettes, glides, of endless clever and
abstract talk through the clear, wide spaces of an intellectual
universe.</p>

<p>However, emotionally, Pepa had never quite grown
up, so perhaps she had missed nothing.</p>

<p>All the same, when he had broken down at her
death, there had been something touching and magnificent
in his fine pity—not for himself, but for Pepa, so
ruthlessly, foolishly, struck down in the hey-day of her
splendid vigour. “It’s devilish! devilish!” he had
sobbed.</p>

<p>During the last days of her life, Pepa had talked to
Teresa a good deal about Anna and Jasper. “Make
them want to be nice people,” she had said; and
Teresa remembered that, even through her misery,
she had wondered that Pepa had not used a favourite
Cambridge <i>cliché</i> and said, “Make them want to be
<i>splendid people</i>”; perhaps it was she, Teresa, who was
undeveloped emotionally.</p>

<p>She had tried hard to do what Pepa had asked her;
but in these latter days, when the outlines of the virtues
have lost their firmness, it is difficult to give children
that concrete sense of Goodness that had made the
Victorian mothers’ simple homilies, in after years,
glow in the memory of their children with the radiance
of a Platonic Myth.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, she must go up to the nursery now.</p>

<p class="tb">She walked into the house. In the hall, as if in
illustration of her views on memory, the light was
falling on, and beautifying a medley of objects, incongruous
as the contents of one’s dreams: the engraving
of Frith’s <i>Margate</i> that had hung in Mr. Lane’s
nursery in the old Kensington house where he had been
born; a large red and blue india-rubber ball dropt by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Anna or Jasper; the old Triana pottery, running in a
frieze round the walls, among which an occasional
Hispano-Mauresque plate yielded up to the touch of the
sun the store of fire hidden in its lustre; a heap of dusty
calling-cards in a flat dish on the table; Arnold’s old
Rugby blazer, hanging, a brave patch of colour, among
the sombre greatcoats.... Through the half-opened
door of the drawing-room came a scent of roses; and
through the green baize door that led to the kitchen the
strange, lewd sounds of servants making merry over
their tea. Probably Gladys, the under-housemaid, was
reading cups.</p>

<p>Teresa mounted the wide, easy stairs, and, passing
through another green baize door, entered the children’s
quarters, and then the nursery itself. There,
tea finished and cleared away, a feeling of vague dissatisfaction
had fallen on the two children. Every minute
bed-time was drawing nearer, and anxious eyes kept
turning towards the door; would any one come before
it was too late, and Jasper was already plunging and
“being silly” in the bath, while Anna, clad in a pink
flannel dressing-gown, her hair in two tight little plaits,
was putting tidy her books and toys, and—so as to
perform the daily good deed enjoined by the Girl
Guides—Jasper’s too?</p>

<p>Their craving for the society of “grown-ups” was
as touching and inexplicable, it seemed to Teresa, as
that of dogs. She had noticed that they longed for it
most between tea and bed-time—it was as if they needed,
then, a <i>viaticum</i> against the tedium of going to bed
and the terrors of the night. Nor, she had noticed,
was Nanny, dearly though they loved her, capable of
giving this <i>viaticum</i>, nor could any man provide it: it
had to be given by a grandmother, or mother, or
aunt.</p>

<p>So Teresa’s advent was very warmly welcomed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and sitting down in the rocking-chair she tried to
perform the difficult task of amusing Anna and Jasper
at the same time. For between Anna of nine and
Jasper of six there was very little in common.</p>

<p>Jasper, like the boy Froissart, “never yet had tired
of children’s games as they are played before the age of
twelve”: these meaningless hidings, and springings,
and booings, and bouncings of balls. His mind, too,
was all little leaps, and springs, and squeals, and queer
little instincts running riot, with a tendency to baby
<i>cabotinage</i>. “Don’t be silly, Jasper!” “Don’t show
off!” were continually being said to him.</p>

<p>Anna’s mind, on the other hand, was completely
occupied with solid problems and sensible interests,
namely, “I hope that silly Meg will marry Mr. Brook
(she was reading Louisa Alcott’s <i>Little Women</i>). I
expect the balls were damp to-day, as they wouldn’t
bounce ... it would be nice if I could get a badge
for tennis next year. <i>Ut</i> with the subjunctive ...
no, no, the accusative and infinitive ... wait a
minute ... I’m not quite sure. Every square with
a stamp in it—every <i>single</i> square. I wonder why
grown-ups don’t spend <i>all</i> their money on stamps. I
wonder if Daddy remembered to keep those Argentine
ones for me ... little pictures of a man that looks
like George—George—George IV., I think—anyhow, the
one that didn’t wear a wig ... the Argentine ones
are always like that ... that’ll make six Argentine
stamps. Brazil ones are pretty, too ... what’s the
capital of Brazil again?”</p>

<p>Teresa had found that a story—one that combined
realism with the marvellous—was the best focus for
these divergent interests; so she started a story.</p>

<p>The sun was setting; and the border and view,
painted on the glass of the nursery windows, grew dim.
Some one in the garden whistled the air of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nanny sat with her sewing, listening too, a pleased
smile on her face, the expression of a vague and complex
feeling of satisfaction: for one thing, it was all so
suitable and what she had been used to in her other
places—kind auntie telling the children a story after
tea; then there was a sense of “moral uplift” as,
doubtless, the story was allegorical; poor Mrs. Sinclair
in heaven, too—she would be glad if she could see
what a good aunt they had—then there was also a
genuine interest in the actual story; for no nurse
without a sense of narrative and the marvellous is fit
for her post.</p>

<p>“Bed-time, I’m afraid. Kiss kind Auntie and say,
‘Thank you, Auntie, for the nice story.’”</p>

<p>Outside, the cowman was leading the cows home to
the byre across the lawn. It was a good thing that
Rudge, the head gardener, was safe in his cottage,
eating his tea. Far away an express flashed across
the view, whistling like a nightjar, giving a sudden
whiff of London that evaporated as swiftly as its smoke.</p>

<p>“But we don’t call her ‘Auntie’; we call her
‘Teresa,’” said Anna for the thousandth time.</p>

<p>“Now, Anna dear, don’t be rude. Up you get,
Jasper. I’m afraid, miss, it really is bed-time ...
and they were late last night too.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Teresa dressed and went down to the drawing-room,
to find her father and Jollypot already there and
chatting amicably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“The place was full of salmon at four and sixpence a
pound, and he said, ‘You’ll never get rid of that!’ and
the fishmonger said, ‘Won’t I? It’ll go like winking,’
and the other chap said, ‘Who’ll buy it these hard
times?’ and he said, ‘The miners, of course.’”</p>

<p>Dick Lane was a stockily-built man of middle height,
with a round, rubicund face. A Frenchman had once
described him as, <i>Le type accompli du farmer-gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>He was, however, a Londoner, born and bred, as his
fathers had been before him for many a generation;
but, as they had always had enough and to spare for
beef and mutton and bacon, the heather of Wales
and the pannage of the New Forest had helped to
build their bones; besides, it was not so very long
ago that cits could go a-maying without being late
for ’Change; and then, there is the Cockney’s dream
of catching, one day before he dies, the <i>piscis rarus</i>—a
Thames trout—a dream which, though it never
be realised, maketh him to lie down in green pastures
and leadeth him beside the still waters.</p>

<p>As to Dick, he liked cricket, and the smell of manure
and of freshly-cut hay, he liked pigs, and he liked wide,
quiet vistas; but he liked them as a background to
his prosaic and quietly regulated activities—much as
a golfer, though mainly occupied with the progress of
the game, subconsciously is not indifferent to the
springy turf aromatic with thyme and scabious, nor
to the pungent breezes from the sea, nor to the sweep
of the downs.</p>

<p>He and Teresa exchanged friendly nods, and she,
sinking into a chair, began to contemplate him—much
as Blake may have contemplated the tiger,
when he wondered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">There he sat, pink from his bath, pleasantly tired after
his two rounds of golf, expounding to Jollypot his
views on the threatened strike—the heir to all the
ages.</p>

<p>For his body and soul were knit from strange old
fragments: sack; fear of the plague; terror of the
stars; a vision of the Virgin Queen borne, like a relic
in a casket, on the shoulders of fantastically-dressed
gentlemen; Walsingham; sailor’s tales of Spanish
ladies; a very English association between the august
word of Liberty and the homely monosyllable Wilkes;
dynasties tottering to the tune of “Lillybolero”;
Faith, Hope, and Charity, stimulated by cries of, “No
Popery,” “Lavender, Sweet Lavender,” “Pity the
poor prisoners of the Fleet”; Dr. Donne thundering
Redemption at Paul’s Cross, the lawn at his wrist
curiously edged with a bracelet of burnished hair;
Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great, Pride, Lechery,
Robin Hood, throbbing in ballads, or else, alive and
kicking and bravely dressed beyond one’s dreams,
floating in barges down the Thames; Death—grinning
in stone from crevices of the churches, dancing in
churchyards with bishops and kings and courtesans,
forming the burden of a hundred songs, and at last, one
day, catching one oneself; Death—but every death
cancelled by a birth.</p>

<p>Without all this he would not have been sitting
there, saying, “The English working man is at bottom
a sensible chap, and if they would only appeal to his
common sense it would be all right.”</p>

<p>Then the gong sounded. Dick looked at his watch
and remarked, quite good-humouredly, “I wonder
how many times your mother has been in time for
dinner during the thirty years we have been married.”</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and the Doña came in with
Concha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“I have just been saying I wonder how many times
you have been in time for dinner since we were married.”</p>

<p>The Doña ignored this remark, and busied herself
in straightening Teresa’s fichu.</p>

<p>Then they went in to dinner.</p>

<p>“By the way, Anna,” said Dick, looking across at
the Doña and sucking the soup off his moustache, “I
was playing golf with Crofts, and he says there’s going
to be a wonderful new rose at the show this year—terra
cotta coloured. It’s a Lyons one; he says it’s
been got by a new way of hybridising. We must ask
Harry about it.”</p>

<p>“Harry wouldn’t know—he knows nothing about
gardening,” said the Doña scornfully.</p>

<p>“Not know? Why, he’ll know <i>all</i> about it. That
fellow Worthington—you know who I mean, the chap
that went on that commission to India—well, he’s a
knowledgeable sort of chap, and he asked me the other
day at the Club if Dr. Sinclair of Cambridge wasn’t a
son-in-law of mine, and he said that he’d been making
the most wonderful discoveries lately.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of discoveries—of Harry’s, at any
rate? They do no one any good,” said the Doña
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; there’s no knowing what these
things mayn’t lead to—they may teach us to improve
the human stock and all sorts of things”; and then
Dick applied himself to the more interesting subject of
his fried sole, oblivious, in spite of years of experience,
that his remark had horrified his wife by its impious
heresy.</p>

<p>However, her only comment was an ironical smile.</p>

<p>“To learn to know people through flowers—what a
lovely idea,” mused Jollypot, who was too absent-minded
to be tactful. “I think it is his work among
flowers that makes Dr. Sinclair so—so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>——”</p>

<p>“So like a flower himself, eh?” grinned Dick, with
a sudden vision of his large, massive, overbearing
son-in-law.</p>

<p>“I’m sure flowers really irritate Harry horribly,”
said Concha. “They’ve probably got the Oxford
manner, or are not Old Liberals, or something.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Concha. Both flowers and
children irritate him,” said the Doña bitterly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Dick, with indifferent good
humour. “By the way,” he added, “I’ve asked a
young fellow called Munroe down for the week-end.
He’s representing a South African sugar firm we have
to do with ... it’ll be all right, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, Arnold’s written to say he’s coming, and he
doesn’t like strangers, you know,” said the Doña.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blessed ... has it come to this ...”
he spluttered, roused completely out of his habitual
good humour.</p>

<p>“No, it hasn’t,” said Concha soothingly, and laid a
hand on his.</p>

<p>“Well, all the same, it’s ...” he growled; and
then subsided, slightly appeased.</p>

<p>The Doña, quite unmoved, continued placidly eating
her sole. Then she remarked, “And where is your
friend to sleep, may I ask? Arnold is bringing down
Guy and a cousin of his. When the children are here
you <i>know</i> how little room we have.”</p>

<p>“I suppose one of them—Arnold, as far as that
goes—can sleep at Rudge’s,” said Dick sulkily.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can sleep in Dad’s dressing-room, if it comes
to that,” said Teresa.</p>

<p>“Or I can,” said Concha.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you’re so much more dependent on your
own dressing-table and your own things,” said Teresa;
and Concha blushed. Innocent remarks of Teresa’s had
a way of making her blush; but she was a fighter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the good Colonial like?” she asked, her
voice not quite natural—and thinking the while, “I
<i>will</i> ask if I choose! It’s absolutely unbearable how
self-conscious they’re making me—it’s like servants.”</p>

<p>“The Colonial—what Colonial? Oh, Monroe! He’s
a Scot really, but he’s been out there some years;
done jolly well, too. He’s a gallant fellow, too—V.C.
in the war.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no-o-o!” drawled Concha, “<i>how</i> amusing!
V.C.’s are so exotic—it’s like seeing a fox suddenly in
a wood——” and then she blushed again, for she
realised that this remark was not original, but Guy
Cust’s, and that Teresa was looking at her.</p>

<p>“What’s he like?” she went on hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know ... he’s a great big chap,” and
then he added cryptically, “pretty Scotch, I should say.”</p>

<p class="tb">When dinner was over, the Doña went up to the
nursery to apologise, in case the children were still
awake, for not having been up before to say good-night.
She found they were asleep, however, but Nanny was
sitting in the day-nursery darning a jersey of Jasper’s;
so, partly to avoid having had the trouble of climbing
the stairs for nothing, partly because she had been
seeking for some time the occasion for a private chat,
she sank into the rocking-chair—looking extremely
distinguished in her black lace mantilla and velvet
gown.</p>

<p>Her brown eyes, with the quizzical droop of the lids
that Teresa had inherited, fixed Nanny in a disconcerting
Spanish stare.</p>

<p>How thankful she was that <i>she</i> did not have to wear
a gown of black serge fastening down her chest with
buttons, and a starched white cap.</p>

<p>“I think the children have had a happy summer,”
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, madam. There’s nowhere like Plasencia—and
no one like Granny and Auntie!”</p>

<p>There was a definite matter upon which the Doña
wanted information; but it required delicate handling.
She was on the point of approaching it by asking if the
children were not very lonely at Cambridge, but realising
that this would be a reflection upon Nanny she
immediately abandoned it—no one could deal more
cavalierly, when she chose, with the feelings of others
than the Doña; but she never <i>inadvertently</i> hurt a
fly.</p>

<p>So what she said was, “I suppose Dr. Sinclair is
always very busy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—always working away at his stocks and
his chickens,” said Nanny placidly, holding a small
hole up to the light. “He’s managed to get that bit
of ground behind the garden, and he’s planted it with
nothing but stocks. He lets Anna help him with the
chickens. She’s becoming quite a little companion to
her Daddy.”</p>

<p>“That is delightful,” purred the Doña; then, after
a pause, “He must be terribly lonely, poor man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he frets a lot, I’m sure; but, of course,
gentlemen don’t show it so much.”</p>

<p>“Ah?” and there was a note of suppressed eagerness
in the interjection.</p>

<p>Nanny began to feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As dogs who live much with human beings develop
an agonising sensitiveness, so servants are apt to
develop from an intimacy with their masters a delicacy
and refinement of feeling often much greater than that
of the masters.</p>

<p>At the bottom of her heart, she resented Dr. Sinclair’s
indifference to his children—at any rate, his indifference
to Jasper—for Anna, who was a remarkably
intelligent little girl, he rather liked. But with regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to Jasper, he had once remarked to a crony at dinner
that, with the exception of the late Lord —— (naming
a famous man of science), his son was the greatest bore
he had ever met; which remark had been repeated by
the parlour-maid in a garbled version to the indignant
Nanny.</p>

<p>Then, in decent mourning, a broken heart as well as
a crape band must be worn on the sleeve; Dr. Sinclair’s
sleeve was innocent of either, and it could not be denied
that within eight months of his wife’s death his voice
was as loud and cheerful, his eyes as bright, as ever
before.</p>

<p>Yes; but it was quite another matter to be pumped,
even by “Granny,” or to admit to any one but her
own most secret heart that “Daddy” could, under
any circumstances, behave otherwise than as the model
of all the nursery virtues.</p>

<p>There was a short silence; then the Doña said,
“Yes, poor man! It must be very dull for him. But
I suppose he is beginning to see his friends?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, madam, the College gentlemen sometimes
come to talk over his work with him,” and Nanny
pursed up her lips, and accelerated the speed with which
she was threading her needle through her warp. “It’s
a blessing, I’m sure,” she added, “that he has his work
to take off his thoughts sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!”; then, after a slight pause, “What
about that Miss—what was her name—the lady professor—Miss
Fyles-Smith? Is she still working with
Dr. Sinclair?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say, madam, I’m sure. She was very
kind, taking the children on the river, and that—<i>when
Dr. Sinclair was away</i>.”</p>

<p>The slight emphasis on the temporal clause did more
credit to Nanny’s heart than her head—considering
that the rapier she was parrying was wielded by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Doña; for it caused the Doña to say to herself, “Aha!
she knows what I mean, does she? There must be
something in it then.”</p>

<p>However, this was loyal, faithful service, and the
Doña had an innate respect for the first-rate; but,
though honouring Nanny, she did not feel in the least
ashamed of herself.</p>

<p>She changed the subject, and sat on, for a while,
chatting on safe, innocent topics.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The Doña considered that no sand-dune, Turkish
divan, bank whereon the wild thyme blows, or Patriarch’s
bosom, could rival her own fragrant-sheeted,
box-spring-mattressed, eiderdowned bed; therefore she
went there early and lay there late. So on leaving
the nursery, although it was barely half-past nine, she
went straight to bed, and there she was soon established,
her face smeared with Crême Simon, with a Spanish
novel lying open on the quilt. But the comfort of
beds, as of all other things—even though they be
ponderable and made of wood and iron—is subject to
the capricious tyranny of dreams; and for some time,
in spite of the skill of Mr. Heal, the Doña’s bed had not
been entirely compact of roses.</p>

<p>When, an hour or so later, Dick climbed into his bed,
she said, “I suppose you realise that Harry has forgotten
all about my Pepa?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Anna! Poor chap, you don’t expect
him to be always whimpering, do you? I tell you, the
English aren’t demonstrative.”</p>

<p>“Nor are the Spaniards, but they have a great deal
of heart all the same; and Harry has absolutely none—I
don’t believe he has any soul either.”</p>

<p>“So much the better then; he can’t be damned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>This was an unusually acute and spiteful remark—for
Dick. The Doña had never confided to him her
vicarious terrors touching the apostasy of Pepa, who
had not had her children baptised, and, during her last
illness, had refused to the end the ministrations of Holy
Church; but one cannot pass many years in close
physical intimacy with another person without getting
an inkling, though it be only subconsciously, of that
person’s secret thoughts; and though Dick had never
consciously registered his knowledge of the Doña’s, the
above remark had been made with intention to wound.</p>

<p>His irritation at her criticism of Harry was caused
by a sense of personal guilt: twice, perhaps, during
the last year had his own thoughts dwelt spontaneously
upon Pepa—certainly not oftener.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief he put out the light, shook
himself into a comfortable position, and then got into
the shadowy yacht in which every night he sailed towards
his dreams. With that tenderness of males
(which deserves the attention of the Freudians) towards
any vehicle—be it horse, camel, motor-car, or ship—he
knew and loved every detail of her equipment; and
in the improvements which, from time to time, he
made in her he observed a rigid realism—never, for
instance, making them unless they were justified by
the actual state of his bank-book. The only concession
that he made to pure fancy was that there was no
wife and children to be considered in making his budget.
On the strength of an unexpected dividend, he had
recently had her fitted out with a wireless installation.
The only guests were his life-long friend, Hugh Mallam,
and a pretty, though shadowy and somewhat Protean,
young woman.</p>

<p>As to the Doña, she lay for hours staring with wide
eyes at the darkness. Why, oh why, had she married
a Protestant? Just to annoy her too vigilant aunts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
for the sake of novelty and excitement she had, in spite
of her confessor, run off with a round-faced, unromantic
young Englishman—really unromantic, but for her
with the glamour that always hangs round hereditary
enemies. Perhaps she deserved to be punished: but
when they had been little she had been so sure of her
children—how could they ever be anything but her
own creatures, pliable to her touch? Even Arnold,
brought up a Protestant (he had been born before the
Bull exacting that all children of a mixed marriage
should be Catholics), she had been certain that, once
his own master, he would come over. She smiled as
she remembered how he used to say when he was at
school—as a joke—“Oh, yes, I’m going to be the Pope,
and I’ll have a special issue of stamps to be used in
the Vatican, then after a few days suppress ’em; so
I’ll have a corner in them!” And though he had
<i>not</i> come over to Rome, there was a certain relaxing of
tension as she thought of him; somehow or other, it
made it different his having been born before the Bull.
But Pepa—that was another thing: a member of the
Catholic fold from her infancy ... where could she
be now but in that portion of Purgatory which is outside
the sphere of influence of prayers and masses, and
which will one day be known as Hell? Before her
passed a series of realistic pictures of those torments,
imprinted on her imagination during <i>las semanas de los
ejerjicios espirituales</i> of her girlhood.</p>

<p>Could it be?... No, it was impossible....
Impossible? Pepa had died in mortal sin ... she
was there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Arnold Lane and Guy Cust had been great friends at
Cambridge, in spite of having been at different colleges,
and having cultivated different poses.</p>

<p>Guy, who was an Etonian, had gone in for intellectual
and sartorial foppishness, for despising feminine society,
for quoting “Mr. Pope” and “Mr. Gibbon,” and for
frequenting unmarried dons.</p>

<p>Arnold had been less exclusive—had painted the
town a “greenery-yellow” with discalceated Fabians,
read papers on Masefield to the “Society of Pagans,”
and frequently played tennis at the women’s colleges;
he had also, rather shamefacedly, played a good deal of
cricket and football.</p>

<p>Then, at the end of their last year, came the War,
and they had both gone to the front.</p>

<p>The trenches had turned Arnold into an ordinary
and rather Philistine young man.</p>

<p>As to Guy—he had undergone what he called a
conversion to the “amazing beauty of modern life,”
and, abandoning his idea of becoming a King’s don and
leading that peculiar existence which, like Balzac’s
novel, is a <i>recherche de l’Absolu</i> in a Dutch interior,
when the War was over he had settled in London,
where he tried to express in poetry what he called
“the modern mysticism”—that sense, made possible
by wireless and cables, of all the different doings of
the world happening <i>simultaneously</i>: London, music-halls,
Broad Street, Proust writing, people picking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
oranges in California, mysterious processes of growth
or decay taking place in the million trees of the myriad
forests of the world, a Javanese wife creeping in and
stabbing her Dutch rival. One gets the sense a little
when at the end of <i>The Garden of Cyrus</i> Sir Thomas
Browne says: “The huntsmen are up in America
and they are already past their first sleep in Persia.”
Its finest expression, he said, was to be found in the
<i>Daily Mirror</i>.</p>

<p>But early training and tastes are tenacious. We
used to be taught that, while we ought not to wish for
the palm without the dust, we should, nevertheless,
keep Apollo’s bays immaculate; and, in spite of their
slang, anacoluthons, and lack of metre, Guy’s poems
struck some people (Teresa, for instance) as being not
the bays but the aspidistras of Apollo—dusted by the
housemaid every morning.</p>

<p>Towards five o’clock, the next day, their arrival
was announced by ’Snice excitably barking at
the front door, and by Concha—well, the inarticulate
and loud noises of welcome with which
Concha always greeted the return of her father,
brother, or friends, is also best described by the
word “barking.”</p>

<p>“It’s a friendly gift; I’m sure no ‘true woman’ is
without it,” thought Teresa.</p>

<p>Arnold had his father’s short, sturdy body and his
mother’s handsome head; Guy was small and slight,
with large, widely-opened, china-blue eyes and yellow
hair; he was always exquisitely dressed; he talked in
a shrill voice, always at a tremendous rate. They were
both twenty-seven years old.</p>

<p>As usual, they had tea out on the lawn; the Doña
plying Arnold with wistful questions, in the hopes of
getting fresh material for that exact picture of his life
in London that she longed to possess, that, by its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
help, she might, in imagination, dog his every step,
hear each word he uttered.</p>

<p>Up in the morning, say at eight (she hoped his landlady
saw that his coffee was hot), then at his father’s
office by nine, then ... but she never would be able
to grasp the sort of things men did in offices, then
luncheon—she hoped it was a good one (no one else
had ever had any fears of Arnold’s not always doing
himself well), then ... hazy outlines and details
which she knew were all wrong, and, in spite of the
many years she had spent in England, ridiculously like
the life of a young Spaniard in her youth ... no,
no, he would never begin his letters to young ladies
<i>ojos de mi corazon</i> (eyes of my heart)—they would be
more like this: Dear ——? Fed up. Have you read?
Cheerio! Amazing performance! Quite. Allow me
to remind you.... And then, perhaps, a Latin
quotation to end up. No, it was no use, she would
never be able to understand it all.</p>

<p>“A Scotch protégé of Dad’s is coming to-night,”
said Concha; “he’ll probably travel down with Rory
Dundas—I wonder if they’ll get on ... oh, Guy, I
hadn’t noticed them before; what divine spats!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” groaned Arnold, “it’s that chap
Munroe, I suppose. Look here, I don’t come down here
so often, I think I might be left alone when I do,
Mother,” and he turned angrily to the Doña. It was
only in moments of irritation that he called her
“mother.”</p>

<p>“And I think so, too. I <i>told</i> your father that you
would not be pleased.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, it’s come to this, that I’ll give up
coming home at all,” and he savagely hacked himself a
large slice of cake.</p>

<p>A look of terror crept into the Doña’s eyes—her
children vanishing slowly, steadily, over the brow of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
hill, while she stood rooted to the ground, was one of
her nightmares.</p>

<p>Trying to keep the anger out of her voice, Teresa
said, “The last time you were here there were no
visitors at all, and the time before it was all your own
friends.”</p>

<p>“Quite. But that is no reason....”</p>

<p>“Poor angel!” cried Concha, plumping down on his
knee, “you’re like Harry, who used to say that he’d
call his house Yarrow that it might be ‘unvisited.’”</p>

<p>Arnold grinned—the Boswellian possessive grin,
automatically produced in every Trinity man when a
sally of Dr. Sinclair’s was quoted.</p>

<p>“How I love family quarrels! By the way, where’s
Mr. Lane?” said Guy.</p>

<p>“Playing golf,” answered the Doña curtly.</p>

<p>“The glorious life he leads! ‘The apples fall about
his head!’ He does lead an amazingly beautiful
life.”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Beautiful</i>,’ Guy?” and the Doña turned on him
the look of pitying wonder his remarks were apt to
arouse in her.</p>

<p>“Yes, successful, middle-aged business men,” cried
Guy excitedly, beginning to wave his hands up and
down, “they’re the only happy people ... they’re
like Keats’ Nightingale, ‘no hungry generations tread
them down, singing of....’”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” laughed Arnold. “We’re
certainly hungry, and we often trample on him—if
that’s what it means,” and, getting up, he yawned,
stretched himself, and, seizing the Doña’s hand, said,
“Come and show me the garden.”</p>

<p>The Doña flushed with pleasure, and they strolled
off towards the border, whither they were shortly
followed by Concha.</p>

<p>Teresa and Guy sat on by the tea-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“I quite agree with you,” she said presently. “Dad’s
life <i>is</i> pleasant to contemplate. Somehow, he belongs
to this planet—he manages to be happy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you see he doesn’t try to pretend that he
belongs to a different scheme of evolution from beasts
and trees and things, and he doesn’t dream. Do you
think he ever thinks of his latter end?” and he gave a
little squeak of laughter.</p>

<p>Teresa smiled absently, and for some seconds gazed
in silence at the view. Then she said, “Think of all
the things happening everywhere ... but there are
such gaps that we can’t feel the <i>process</i>—even in ourselves;
we can only register results and that isn’t living,
and it’s frightfully unæsthetic.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Teresa, that’s what <i>I’m</i> always
preaching!” cried Guy indignantly. “It’s exactly
this registering of results instead of living through
processes that is so frightful. In a poem you shouldn’t
say, ‘Hullo! There’s a lesser celandine!’ all ready-made,
you know; and then start moralising about it:
‘In its unostentatious performance of its duty it reminds
me of a Mr. Wilkinson, a clergyman that I once knew’—you
know the sort of thing. In your poem the lesser
celandine should go through the whole process of
growth—and then it should wither and die.”</p>

<p>“No, Guy; it can’t be done ... in music, perhaps,
but that’s so vague.”</p>

<p>Guy felt a sudden sinking in his stomach: had he
not himself invented a technique to do this very thing?
He must find out at all costs what Teresa thought of
his poetry.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think ...” he began nervously, “that
modern poetry is getting much nearer to—to—er—processes?”</p>

<p>Teresa gave a little smile. So <i>that</i> was what it was
all leading up to? Was there no one with whom she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
could discuss things simply and honestly for their own
sake?</p>

<p>“Did you—er—ever by any chance read my poem
on King’s Cross?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was very good.”</p>

<p>She felt tempted to add, “It reminded me a little bit
of Frith,” but she refrained. It would be very unkind
and really not true.</p>

<p>Her praise, faint though it was, made Guy tingle all
over with pleasure, and he tumbled out, in one breath,
“Well, you see, it’s really a sort of trick (everything is).
Grammar and logic must be thrown overboard, and it’s
not that it’s easier to write without them, it’s much
more difficult; Monsieur Jourdain was quite wrong in
calling logic <i>rébarbative</i>; as a matter of fact, it’s damnably
easy and seductive—so’s grammar; the Song of
the Sirens was probably sung in faultless grammar ...
and anyhow, it spoils everything. Now, just think of
the most ridiculous line in the Prelude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">... and negro ladies in white muslin gowns.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Don’t you see it’s entirely the fault of the conjunction
‘and’? Try it this way. Oranges, churches, cabriolets,
negro ladies in white muslin gowns.... It immediately
becomes as significant and decorative as Manet’s negro
lady is a white muslin gown in the Louvre—the one
offering a bouquet to Olympia.”</p>

<p>He paused, and looked at her a little sheepishly, a
smile lurking in the corner of his eyes.</p>

<p>“You’re too ridiculous,” laughed Teresa, “and
theories about literature, you know, are rather dangerous,
and allow me to point out that all the things
that ... well, that one perhaps regrets in poor Wordsworth,
whom you despise so much, that all these things
are the result of his main theory, namely, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
everything is equally interesting and equally poetic.
While the other things—the incomparable things—happened
<i>in spite</i> of his theories.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes ... trudging over the moors through the
rain, and he’s sniffing because he’s lost his handkerchief,
and he’s thinking of tea—sent him by that chap in
India or China, what was his name? You know ...
the friend of Lamb’s—and of hot tea cakes.”</p>

<p>Teresa gave her cool, superior smile. “Poor Guy!
You’ve got a complex about Wordsworth.”</p>

<p>After a little pause, she went on, “Literature, I
think, ought to <i>transpose</i> life ... turn it into a new
thing. It has to come pushing up through all the
endless labyrinths of one’s mind—like catechumens in
the ancient Mysteries wandering through cave after
cave of strange visions, and coming out at the other
end new men. I mean ... oh, it’s so difficult to say
what I mean ... but one looks at—say, that view,
and the result is that one writes—well, the love story
of King Alfred, or ... a sonnet on a sun-dial. I
remember I once read a description by a psychologist
of the process that went on in the mind of a certain
Italian dramatist: he would be teased for months by
some abstract philosophical idea and gradually it
would turn itself into, and be completely lost in an
<i>action</i>—living men and women doing things. It seems
to me an extraordinarily beautiful process—really
creative.... Transubstantiation, that’s what it is
really; but the bad writers are like priests who haven’t
proper Orders—they can scream <i>hoc est corpus</i> till they
are hoarse, but nothing happens.”</p>

<p>Guy had wriggled impatiently during this monologue;
and now he said, in a very small voice, “You ...
you <i>do</i> like my poetry, don’t you, Teresa?”</p>

<p>She looked at him; of course, he deserved to be
slapped for his egotism and vanity, but his eager,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
babyish face was so ridiculous—like Jasper’s—and when
Jasper climbed on to the chest of drawers and shouted,
“Look at me, Teresa! <i>Teresa!</i> Look at me!” as
if he had achieved the ascent of Mount Everest, she
always feigned surprise and admiration.</p>

<p>So, getting up, she said with a smile, “I think you’re
an amazingly brilliant creature, Guy—I do really.
Now I must go.”</p>

<p>He felt literally intoxicated with gratification. “I
think you’re an amazingly brilliant creature; <i>I think
you’re an amazingly brilliant creature; an amazingly
brilliant creature</i>”—he sucked each word as if it were
a lollipop.</p>

<p>Then, the way she affectionately humoured him—that
was the way women always treated geniuses:
geniuses were apt to seem a trifle ridiculous; probably
the impression he made on people was somewhat
similar to Swinburne’s.</p>

<p>He got up and tripped across the lawn to a clump of
fuchsias.</p>

<p>Yes; he had certainly been very brilliant with
Teresa: <i>the song of the sirens was, I am sure, in faultless
grammar; the song of the sirens was, I am sure, in faultless
grammar; the song of the</i> ... and how witty he
had been about the negro ladies!</p>

<p>He really must read a paper on his own views on
poetry—to an audience mainly composed of women:
<i>The cultivated have, without knowing it, become the
Philistines, and, scorning the rude yet lovely Saturnalia
of modern life, have refused an angel the hospitality of
their fig-tree; Tartuffe, his long, red nose pecksniffing—the
day of the Puritans is over; but for the sake of the
Lady of Christ’s, let them enjoy undisturbed their domestic
paradise regained</i>; then all these subjects locked up so
long and now let loose by modern poetry ... yes, it
would go like this: <i>The harems have been thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
open, and, though as good reactionaries we may
deplore the fact, yet common humanity demands that
we should lend a helping hand to the pretty lost
creatures in their embroidered shoes</i>; then, about
anacoluthons and so on; <i>surely one’s sentences need
not hold water if they hold the milk of Paradise</i>; oh,
yes ... of course ... and he would end up by
reading them a translation of Pindar’s first Olympian
Ode, ... Ἄριστον μὲν ὕδωρ ..., <i>and now, ladies and
gentlemen, which of you will dare to subscribe to Malherbe’s
‘ce galimatias de Pindare’?</i></p>

<p>Loud applause; rows of indulgent, admiring, cultured
smiles—like the Cambridge ladies when the giver of the
Clark lectures makes a joke.</p>

<p>“Guy! I have told you before, I will <i>not</i> have you
cracking the fuchsia buds.”</p>

<p>It was the Doña, calling out from the border where,
deserted by Arnold but joined by Dick, she was examining
and commenting upon each blossom separately, in
the manner of La Bruyère’s amateur of tulips.</p>

<p>“All right,” he called back in a small, weak voice,
and went up to say, “How d’ye do” to Dick.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Guy! Been writing any more poetry?”</p>

<p>This was Dick’s invariable greeting of him.</p>

<p>Then he wandered off towards the house—a trifle
crestfallen. “<i>I think you’re an amazingly brilliant
creature.</i>” Yes; but wasn’t that begging the question,
the direct question he had asked whether she liked
his poetry? And one could be “an amazingly brilliant
creature,” and, at the same time, but an indifferent
writer. Marie Bashkirsteff, for instance, whose journal
he had come upon in an attic at home, mouldering away
between a yellow-backed John Strange Winter and a
<i>Who’s Who</i> of the nineties; no one could deny that
socially she must have been extremely brilliant, but,
to him, it had seemed incredible that the world should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
have failed to perceive that her “self-revelations”
were to a large extent faked, and her imagination a
tenth-rate one. And now, both as painter and writer,
Time had shown her up, together with the other
<i>pompiers</i> whose work had made such a brave show
in the Salons of the eighties, or had received such
panegyrics in the <i>Mercure de France</i>.</p>

<p>He felt sick as he thought of time, in fifteen years
... ten years ... having corroded the brilliant flakes
of contemporary paint, faded the arabesque of strange
words and unexpected thoughts, and revealed underneath
the grains of pounce.</p>

<p>Brilliant ... there was Oscar Wilde, of course ...
but then, Oscar Wilde!</p>

<p>He must find out what value exactly she attached to
brilliancy.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was past seven o’clock when Captain Roderick
Dundas and Mr. David Munroe drove up side by side
to Plasencia.</p>

<p>If they did not find much to say to each other, the
fault was not Rory’s; for he was a friendly creature,
ready, as he put it, “to babble to any one at his grandmother’s
funeral.”</p>

<p>In appearance he was rather like Guy, only much
taller. They had both inherited considerable prettiness
from their respective mothers—“the beautiful
Miss Brabazons,” whose beauty and high spirits had
made a great stir at their <i>début</i> in the eighties.</p>

<p>As to David Munroe; he was a huge man of swarthy
complexion, slow of speech and of movement, and with
large, rather melancholy brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Hullo! We must be arriving. Isn’t it terrifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
arriving at a new house? It’s like going to parties when
one was a child—‘are you sure there’s a clean pocket
handkerchief in your sporran, master Rory?’”</p>

<p>David, turning a puzzled, rather suspicious, look upon
him, said slowly, “Are you Scotch?”</p>

<p>“Lord, yes! I never get my ‘wills and shalls’
right, and I talk about ‘table-maids’ and all sorts of
things. Here we are.”</p>

<p>As they got into the hall, Guy and Arnold came out
from the billiard-room.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Rory!” said Guy, “you can’t have a bath
before dinner because <i>I’m</i> going to have one.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to have it with Concha then, Guy,”
said Arnold, “she’s there regularly from seven till
eight. I wish to God this house had more bathrooms.
Hullo! You’ve got a paper, Dundas—I want to see
the latest news about the Strike.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, David Munroe stood in the background,
looking embarrassed and rather sulky, and
Rendall, the butler, who secretly deplored “Mr.
Arnold’s” manners, said soothingly, “I’ll have your
bag taken up to your room, sir.” Whereupon Arnold
looked up from the paper, greeted him with sullen
excuses, took him up to his room, and hurriedly
left him.</p>

<p>Half an hour later David walked into the drawing-room,
forlorn and shy, in full evening dress. All the
party, except Rory, were already assembled, and he
felt still more uncomfortable when in a flash he
realised that the other men were in dinner-jackets and
black ties.</p>

<p>“Ah! How are you, Munroe?” cried Dick heartily,
“very pleased to see you. So sorry I wasn’t there
when you arrived—didn’t hear the car. Let me
introduce you to my wife.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Munroe. How clever of you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to be dressed in time!” said the Doña. There was
always a note of irony in her voice, and it was confirmed
by the myopic contraction of her eyes; so
David imagined, quite erroneously, that she was “having
a dig” at his tails and white waistcoat. Nor did Dick
improve matters by saying, “I say, Munroe, you put
us all to shame.”</p>

<p>Then Rory came in, so easily, chattering and laughing
as if he had known them all his life—also in a dinner-jacket
and a black tie; because, if poor David had only
known, Arnold had told him it was “just a family party
and he needn’t bother about tails.”</p>

<p>The moment Rory had entered the room, Teresa
had felt a sudden little contraction of her throat, and
had almost exclaimed aloud, “At last!”</p>

<p>In their childhood, she and Pepa had dreamed of,
and craved for, a man doll, made of some supple material
which would allow of its limbs being bent according to
their will, its face modelled and painted with a realism
unknown to the toy shops, a little fair moustache of
real hair that could be twisted, and real clothes that,
of course, came off and on: waistcoat, tie, collar,
braces, and in a pocket a little gold watch.</p>

<p>Their longing for this object had, at one time, become
an obsession, and had reached the point of their regarding
living men entirely from the point of view of whether,
shrunk to twelve inches high, they would make a good
doll.</p>

<p>So Teresa, who had so often deplored the childishness
of her friends and family, actually found herself gazing
with gloating eyes at Rory Dundas—the perfect man
doll, found at last.</p>

<p>Then they went into dinner. Guy took in Teresa;
he was nervous, and more talkative than usual, and
she was unusually <i>distraite</i>.</p>

<p>The room grew hot; every one seemed to be talking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
at once—screaming about the <i>Fifth Form at St. Dominics</i>,
or <i>Black Beauty</i>, or both. It seemed that Arnold,
when he was at Rugby, had exchanged one or both with
Concha for a Shakespeare, illustrated by photographs
of leading actors and actresses, and that he wanted
them back.</p>

<p>“Ah! he is thinking of his own children. Does it
mean ... can he be going to ...?” thought the
Doña, delighted at the thought of the children, frightened
at the thought of the wife.</p>

<p>“You must certainly give them back to Arnold,
Concha; they’re his,” she said firmly.</p>

<p>“I like that! When he got such an extremely good
bargain, too! He always did in his deals with me.”</p>

<p>“Anna has a <i>Black Beauty</i>, you might wangle it out
of her by offering to teach her carpentry or something
... something she could get a new badge for in the
Girl Guides.”</p>

<p>“But it’s my own copy that I want.”</p>

<p>And so on, what time Dick at the foot of the table
shook like a jelly with delighted laughter.</p>

<p>Nothing makes parents—even detached ones like
Dick—so happy as to see their grown-up offspring
behaving like children.</p>

<p>“English hospitality is to <i>make</i> you at home—a
pistol at your head; look at the poor Scot!” said Guy
to Teresa.</p>

<p>She had been trying to hear what Rory was saying
to Concha about the latest <i>Revue</i>, and, looking absently
across at the silent, aloof David, said vaguely, “Oh, yes
of course; he’s Scotch, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Inverness-shire, I should think. They’ve got a
special accent there—not Scotch, but a sort of genteel
English. It’s rather frightening, like suddenly coming
upon a pure white tribe in the heart of Darkest Africa,
it....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Teresa heard no more, but yielded to the curious
intoxication produced by half a glass of claret, the din
of voices, and the hot and brightly lighted room.</p>

<p>By some mysterious anomaly, its action was definitely
Apolline, as opposed to Dionysiac—suddenly lifting her
from the Bacchic rout on the stage to the marble throne
of spectator.</p>

<p>David Munroe, too, sitting silent by the Doña,
happened to be feeling it also.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if the oval mahogany table, on
which the lights glinted and the glasses rattled, and all
the people sitting round it, except himself, suddenly
became an entity, which tore itself away from surrounding
phenomena like the launching of a ship, perhaps....</p>

<p>And at that very moment, “the dark Miss Lane”
was saying to herself, “It’s like the beginning of the
<i>Symposium</i>, which seems at first clumsy and long-winded,
but by which the real thing—the Feast—is
shifted further and further, first to the near past, and
then to years and years ago, when they were all children,
in the days when Agathon was still in Athens and was
making his sacrifice for his victory at the dramatic
contest; pushing the rôle of eyewitness through a
descending scale of remoteness—from Apollodorus to
Phœnix, the son of Philip, from Phœnix to ‘one Aristodemus,
a Cydathenæan,’ till finally It—the Feast,
small, compact, and far-away—disentangles itself from
Space and Time and floats off to the stars, like a fire-balloon,
while Apollodorus and his friend, standing
down there in the streets of Athens, stare up at it with
dazzled eyes.”</p>

<p>“I say, Teresa, I was wondering ... I was thinking
of writing an article on ‘the men of the nineties’—do
you think I should be justified in calling Oscar Wilde
‘brilliant’?”</p>

<p>Teresa, still bemused, gazed at Guy with puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
eyes. Why on earth was he looking so odd and self-conscious?</p>

<p>“Brilliant? Yes; I suppose so. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I was just wondering....”</p>

<p>But the Doña was getting up, and the men were left
to their port.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Dick moved his chair beside David’s, and talked to
him a little about the prospects of sugar, and whether the
Cuban planters were going to “down” all the others;
but, finding him unresponsive, he turned eagerly to
Arnold, saying, “I say! I lunched with Paget-Clark
the other day, and he told me this year’s Rugby fifteen
will be one of the strongest we’ve ever had. There’s a
chap called Girdlestone who, they say, is a perfect
genius as half-back, and they’ve got a new beak
who’s an international and a marvellous coach. He
says....”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, their eleven was jolly good this year. They
did extraordinary well at Lord’s.” There was a slightly
reproving note in Arnold’s voice, as if it were sacrilege
to talk about football when one might talk about
cricket. As a matter of fact, he was much more interested
in football, but he resented that his father
should be able to give him any information about
Rugby.</p>

<p>David smiled to himself as he thought of his own
school—the Inverness Academy.</p>

<p>They had thought themselves very “genteel” with
their school colours and their Latin song beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Floreat Academia</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mater alma, mater pia.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">And indeed this gentility had been rubbed into them
every morning on their way to school by bare-footed
laddies, who shouted after them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gentry puppies, ye’re no verra wice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye eat your parritch wi’ bugs an’ lice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I doubt it wouldn’t seem very genteel to them,”
he thought, without, however, a trace of bitterness.</p>

<p>They began to talk about the prospects of the Cambridge
Boat, and Guy, who prided himself on being
able to talk knowledgeably on such matters, eagerly
joined in with aphorisms on “form.”</p>

<p>“I say, Munroe, we’re nowhere in this show, are
we?” said Rory, with a friendly grin; then suddenly
remembering that he had no legitimate cause for
assuming that David was not a University man (Rory
prided himself on his tact), he added hastily, “mere
sodgers like you and me.”</p>

<p>“I—I understand that the late Dr. Arnold sent his
son to Oxford instead of Cambridge, because—because
at the latter University they didn’t study Aristotle,”
said David.</p>

<p>He genuinely wanted to know about this, because
recently his own thoughts—by way of St. Thomas
Aquinas—had been very much occupied with Aristotle;
but, being shy, his voice sounded aggressive.</p>

<p>“Arnold <i>would</i>,” said the other Arnold coldly.</p>

<p>“But—but Dr. Arnold was surely a great man,
wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>This time David’s voice was unmistakably timid.</p>

<p>The others exchanged smiles.</p>

<p>“Was he? That’s the question,” said Arnold.</p>

<p>A few years ago Dick would have had no hesitation
in exclaiming indignantly, “A great man? I should
just think he <i>was</i>!” Why, he had called his only son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
after him, in spite of the Doña’s marked preference for
Maria-José. But recently his children had insisted on
his reading a small biography of Dr. Arnold that has
since become a classic; very unwillingly had he complied,
as he had expected it to be like Carlyle’s <i>Heroes
and Hero-Worship</i>, which his sister, Joanna, had made
him read in his youth, and which he had secretly loathed;
but he had been pleasantly surprised, and had found
himself at the end in complete agreement with the
writer.</p>

<p>One of Dick’s virtues was an open mind.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> think old Arnold was quite right,” laughed
Rory. “I’m sure it’s most awfully important to
read ... who did you say, Munroe? Aristotle?
Fancy not reading Aristotle! Rotten hole, Cambridge!”</p>

<p>David grinned with such perfect good-nature at this
chaff, that the atmosphere perceptibly warmed in his
favour.</p>

<p>“Oh, well; I dare say there’s a good deal to be said
for Oxford,” said Dick magnanimously.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course! Oxford shoes; Morris-Cowley
cars, summing up the whole of the Oxford movement
... namely, Cowley Fathers and the Preraphaelites!”
shrieked Guy.</p>

<p>“Boar’s Hill!” screamed back Arnold.</p>

<p>“Or the ‘Oxford’—the music-hall, you know,”
suggested Rory.</p>

<p>Then port wine began to come into its own.</p>

<p>There is a certain type of story with but little plot
and the crudest psychology, to appreciate which—as
in the case of the highest poetry—one must have a
love of <i>words</i>—for their own sake.</p>

<p>“... and she thought the toast was ‘<i>Church</i> and
Birmingham’!” ended Guy in a shrill scream.</p>

<p>Rory and Arnold chuckled; Dick shook convulsively,
and a little sheepishly. After all, he <i>was</i> much older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
than the others; besides, he was afraid that his plate
might slip down. He was very fond of his plate, and
much enjoyed clicking it into place, like the right piece
in a jig-saw puzzle; nevertheless, he would die of
humiliation if it slipped down before Arnold.</p>

<p>Story followed story; with each one, the laughter
growing louder and more satyr-like (even David was
smiling gravely); and it was on the best of terms that
the five entered the billiard-room, where, if there were
men, it was the custom at Plasencia to assemble after
dinner.</p>

<p>Arnold immediately organised a game of Snooker
between Dick, Concha, Rory, Guy, and himself; and
the Doña, who was not completely free from a social
conscience, invited David to come and sit beside her
on the sofa.</p>

<p>What on earth was she going to talk to him about?
It had been difficult enough at dinner. Ah, of course!
There was always the War; though there were few
subjects that bored her more.</p>

<p>Though she was as ignorant as the Australian aborigines
of the world’s organisation and configuration, and
of the natural and economic laws by which it is governed,
yet, like an exceptionally gifted parrot, she was
able to manipulate the current <i>clichés</i>, with considerable
tact and dexterity.</p>

<p>For instance, on her annual visit to Wales, she would
say, quite correctly, “Snowdon is very clear to-day,
isn’t it?” And that, though she had not the slightest
idea which of the many peaks on the horizon happened
to be called Snowdon.</p>

<p>Nor did she ever talk about a <i>barrage</i> in connection
with motor-cars, or a <i>carboretto</i> in connection with
guns; though, if asked to define these two words, she
would have been hard put.</p>

<p>So David talked about the War, and she purred or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
sighed or smiled, as the occasion required, and did not
listen to a word.</p>

<p>She noticed that Guy’s eyes kept wandering towards
the chair where Teresa sat motionless. Well, <i>he</i>, at
any rate, had always preferred Teresa to Concha. <i>Why
was she jealous of Concha?</i> It must be Concha’s beauty
that was the trouble.... Teresa, of course, was more
distinguished looking, but Concha was like a Seville
<i>Purissima</i>—infinitely more beautiful.</p>

<p>On and on went David’s voice; Concha, looking
across from the billiard-table, whispered to Arnold,
“<i>No one</i> talks so much really as a ‘strong, silent
man.’”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was a queer time—the War. Things
happened then that people had come to look upon as
impossible—as old wives’ tales. But you’ll hardly
meet a fellow who has been through the War who
hasn’t either himself had some queer sort of experience,
or else had a chum who has. It was a queer time ...
there—there ... were things....”</p>

<p>“Be a sportsman—double the black!” shouted Rory
from the billiard-table.</p>

<p>Teresa, sitting silent in her corner, found herself
muttering:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old ditties sigh about their fathers’ graves;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round every spot where trod Apollo’s foot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where long ago a giant battle was....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jollypot looked up eagerly from her crochet and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell us more about it, Mr. Munroe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it’s only that at times like these ...
things are more ... more naked, maybe,” and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
laughed apologetically. Then he added, as if to himself,
“One sees the star.”</p>

<p>Jollypot murmured something inaudible, and her
eyes filled with sympathetic tears; she was not certain
of what he meant, but was sure it was something beautiful
and mystical.</p>

<p>The Doña wondered if he had had shell-shock.</p>

<p>But Teresa turned in her chair and scrutinised him.
What exactly did he mean? Not, she felt sure, what
she herself would have meant, if she had used these
words, namely, that, during the five years of the War,
one had been continually, or so it seemed in retrospect,
in that Apolline state of intoxication into which she
had fallen that very night at dinner; no, not quite the
same; for that had been purely Apolline, while during
the War it had been at once Apolline and Dionysiac, in
that it was oneself that one was looking at from these
cool heights—oneself, a blind, deaf, dusty maniac,
whirling in a dance.</p>

<p>And, if one liked, one might call such times “heliacal
periods”—a time when the star is visible ... whatever
the star may be.</p>

<p>But David, she felt sure, meant something concrete.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Concha, cut that red and come back on
the blue ... ve-e-ry pree ... oh, hard luck!”</p>

<p>“Now, then ... all eyes on Captain Dundas!...
Captain Dundas pots the black. Well, a very good
game.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Snooker party broke up; the men
wriggling into their dinner-jackets, and Concha standing
by the gramophone and swaying up and down as
she hummed the latest jazz tune.</p>

<p>Guy came up to Teresa. “About Oscar Wilde—I do
want to have a talk to you about him. Do you think—well,
brilliancy—it has a certain literary value, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose so,” she answered absently; she
was watching Concha and Rory giggling by the gramophone.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> am going to bed,” said the Doña, and,
kissing her hand to Arnold, who was still knocking
about the balls, she left the room, followed by Jollypot.</p>

<p>“Well, that was a very successful game,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“What about another one? You’ve <i>got</i> to play
this time, Munroe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, another game. I’ve never seen a game of
Snooker over so quickly ... owing to the amazing
brilliance of our Captain Dundas,” cried Arnold.</p>

<p>So they started another game, this time including
David; and as it had been decided that Rory was too
good for parlour-billiards, he sat down on the sofa
beside Teresa.</p>

<p>They began to talk—about the War, of course:
all the old platitudes—the “team-spirit,” for instance.
“It’s football, you know, that makes us good fighters.
It’s about the only thing we learn at school—the team-spirit.
It teaches us to sacrifice stunts and showy
play and that sort of thing to the whole.”</p>

<p>Then there was the Horse. “It’s extraordinary
how chivalry and ... and ... decent behaviour ...
and everything should be taught us by that old creature
with his funny, long face—but it’s true all the same.
It’s only because we use horses so little in fighting now
that ‘frightfulness’ has begun.”</p>

<p>Teresa felt disappointed; but, after all, what had
she expected?</p>

<p>“But it was a funny time—the old War. All these
tunes—rag-times and Violet Lorraine’s songs—hearing
them first at the Coliseum or Murray’s, and then on
one’s gramophone in the trenches ... it gave one a
feeling ... I don’t know!” and he broke off with a
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“I know! Tunes ... it is very queer,” murmured
Teresa.</p>

<p>It struck her with a stab of amusement that her
tone of reverent sympathy was rather like Jollypot’s—always
agog to encourage any expression of the pure
and poetical spirit that she was sure was burning in
every young male bosom.</p>

<p>“Yes, it <i>was</i> ... an extraordinary time—for all of
us; but for you in the trenches! And all that death—I’ve
often wondered about that; how did it strike you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that was nothing new to <i>me</i>—I mean
some people hadn’t realised till the War that there was
such a thing; but my old Nanny died when I was nine—and
then, there was my mother.”</p>

<p>He paused; and then in quite a different tone he
said:</p>

<p>“Did it used to scare you stiff when you were a child
if you heard the clock strike midnight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>yes</i>—did it you?”</p>

<p>“Rather. And could you scare yourself stiff by
staring at your own reflection in a mirror?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>yes</i>.”</p>

<p>They laughed.</p>

<p>But Teresa felt the presence of the angel Intimacy—a
presence which, when it comes between a man and a
woman, shuffles the dreams and, so it seems, causes
the future to stir in its sleep.</p>

<p>“I say! Isn’t this extraordinary? We <i>are</i> getting
on well, aren’t we? One doesn’t often talk to a person
about these sort of things the first time one meets
them,” and Rory gave a light, mocking laugh.</p>

<p>Teresa felt absurdly, exaggeratedly disappointed;
and why did he use such a strongly scented hair-wash?</p>

<p>The second game of Snooker came to an end, David,
this time, potting the black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Munroe, what about a ‘wee doch-an-doris’?”
said Dick, opening the tantalus.</p>

<p>Concha stretched her soft, supple mouth in an
enormous yawn, rubbed her head on Dick’s shoulder,
and said, “Dad always talks to the Irish in a brogue
and to the Scotch like Harry Lauder—it’s <i>his</i> joke.”</p>

<p>“And theirs, I suppose, is to answer in English,”
said Rory, getting up from the sofa and merging at
once into the atmosphere of the Snookerites.</p>

<p>Teresa wondered if it were consciously that Concha
was always more affectionate to their father when she
had strange men for an audience. Then, seeing in
Guy’s eye that he wanted to continue his idiotic talk
about Oscar Wilde and brilliance, she slipped away to
bed.</p>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>The next morning Teresa dressed very carefully; she
put on a lilac knitted gown, cut square and low at the
neck, and a long necklace of jade.</p>

<p>She got down to breakfast to find Arnold, Jollypot,
Rory, and Guy already settled.</p>

<p>Rory looked at her with unseeing eyes, and got her
her tea and boiled egg with obviously perfunctory
politeness.</p>

<p>He was clearly eager to get back to the conversation
with Guy which she had interrupted by her arrival and
needs.</p>

<p>“But you know, Guy, the only <i>amusing</i> relation we
had was old Lionel Fane—he was a <i>priceless</i> old boy
... what was it he used to say again when he was
introduced to a lady?”</p>

<p>“‘How d’ye do, how d’ye do, oh beautiful passionate
body that never has ached with a heart!’ And then,
do you remember how he used to turn down his sock
and scratch his ankle, and then look round with a
grin and say, ‘I don’t mean to be provocative.’ ...”</p>

<p>“He <i>was</i> priceless! And then....”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake stop talking about your beastly
relations,” growled Arnold; but Guy went on, undaunted.</p>

<p>“But the person I should have liked to have been
was my mother or yours when they were young—their
portraits by Richmond hanging in the Academy with
a special policeman and roped off from the crowd—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
that in the days of the Jersey Lily, too! Oh, it
would have been glorious to have been a beauty of
the eighties.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but one might as well have gone the whole
hog, you know—been the Prince of Wales’s mistress,
and that sort of thing. Your mother, of course, didn’t
make such a very bad match, but mine—a miserable
younger son of a Scotch laird! I mean, I think they
might have done a lot better for themselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! Let’s start a conversation about <i>our</i>
relations, Teresa. Edward Lane, now ...” said
Arnold.</p>

<p>But he could not down the shrill scream of Guy,
once more taking up the tale: “Well, they weren’t,
of course, so cinemaish as the Sisters Gunning, for
instance ... but still, it was all rather amusing ...
and all these queer Victorian stunts they invented....”</p>

<p>“Kicking off their shoes in the middle of a reel, and
that sort of thing? Uncle Jimmy says there was
quite a little war in Dublin as to which was the belle of
the Royal Hospital Ball, then afterwards, too, in
Scotland at the Northern Meeting....”</p>

<p>“I should have liked to have seen them driving
with Ouida in Florence—the Italians saying, <i>bella,
bella</i>, when they passed them, and Ouida graciously
bowing and taking it as a tribute to herself.”</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i>! And then they....”</p>

<p>Then Concha strolled in, and Rory immediately
broke off his sentence, jumped up eagerly, and cried,
“Grant and Cockburn, please—four buttons, lilac.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this about?” said Arnold.</p>

<p>“Oh! I bet her a pair of spats last night that I’d
be down to breakfast before her. Tea or coffee? I
say, I suddenly remembered in the middle of the night
the name of that priceless book I was telling you about;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
it’s <i>Strawberry Leaves</i>, by A. Leaf—I’ll try to get it
for you.”</p>

<p>Evidently the “angel Intimacy” had been very busy
last night after Teresa had gone to bed.</p>

<p>Then the Doña appeared—to the surprise of her
daughters, as she generally breakfasted in her room.</p>

<p>Her appearance was a protest. Dick had decided
(most unnecessarily, she considered) to have a cold
and a day in bed.</p>

<p>Her eye immediately fell on Teresa, and in a swift,
humorous glance from top to toe she took in all the
details of her toilette.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, but I prefer helping myself,”
she said curtly to Rory; his attentiveness seemed
to her a direct reflection on Arnold, who never waited
on any one. Nor did she encourage his attempts at
conversation. “I have been telling Miss Concha....”
“I do hope you’ll take me round the garden—I know
all about that sort of thing, I do really.”</p>

<p>It was a superb day, and the sun was beating fiercely
on the tightly-shut windows; the room smelt of
sausages and bacon and tea and soap and hair-wash.
Teresa felt that the sight of the pulpy eviscera of
Arnold’s roll would soon make her sick.</p>

<p>“By the way, where’s the Scot?” said Concha.
“Arnold, hadn’t you better go up and find him?”</p>

<p>A scuffling was heard behind the door, and in burst
Anna and Jasper, having, in spite of Nanny, simply
scrambled through their nursery breakfast, as thrilled
as ’Snice himself by the smell of new people. Jasper
was all wriggling and squeaking in his desire for
attention; Anna, outwardly calmer, was wondering
whether Rory had relations abroad, and whether they
wrote to him, and what the stamps on the envelopes
were like.</p>

<p>“Now then, gently, darlings, gently! Wait a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
minute; here you are, Jasper,” and the Doña held
out to him a spoonful of honey.</p>

<p>“But where is our good Scot?” repeated Concha.</p>

<p>“The worst of going up to Cambridge is that one
never goes down,” shouted Guy to Jollypot, for want
of a better audience; whereupon, regardless of the
fact that Guy was still talking, Jollypot began to repeat
to herself in a low, emotional voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Does the road wind uphill all the way?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yes, to the very end.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will the day’s journey take the whole long day?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From morn to night, my friend.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jasper began to wriggle worse than ever, and, having
first cast a furtive glance at his grandmother and
aunts, said shrilly, “I dreamt of Mummie last night
... and she had ... she had ... such a funny
nose....” and his voice tailed off in a little giggle,
half proud, half guilty.</p>

<p>“Jasper!” exclaimed simultaneously the Doña,
Teresa, Concha, and Anna, in tones of shocked reproval.</p>

<p>“Dear little man!” murmured Jollypot.</p>

<p>Shortly after her death, Jasper had genuinely dreamt
that his mother was standing by his bed, and, on telling
it next morning, had produced a most gratifying impression;
but so often had he tried since to produce
the same impression in the same way that to say he
had “dreamt of Mummie” had become a recognised
form of “naughtiness”; and, as one could attract
attention by naughtiness as well as by pathos, he continued
at intervals to announce that he had “dreamt
of Mummie.”</p>

<p>“Concha, Teresa, Jollypot! We must hurry. The
car will soon be here to take us to mass,” said the
Doña.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>Concha hesitated a moment—Teresa’s eye was on
her—then said to herself, “I’ll <i>not</i> be downed by her,”
and aloud, “I don’t think I’m coming this morning,
Doña.”</p>

<p>The Doña raised her eyebrows; Teresa’s face was
sphinx-like.</p>

<p>At that moment in walked David—looking a little
embarrassed.</p>

<p>He gravely faced the friendly sallies; and then he
said, with an evident effort:</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t sleep in, its ... I’ve been to early
mass.”</p>

<p>“Walked?” exclaimed Arnold. “Lord!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Munroe, I’m so sorry!” cried the Doña,
“you should have told me last night ... you see, I
didn’t know you were a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“I bet you don’t know what ‘to sleep in’ means,”
Rory whispered to Concha.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me Mr. Munroe was a Catholic?”
said the Doña as she was putting on her things for
mass.</p>

<p>“How could I have told you when I didn’t know
myself?” answered Dick from his bed.</p>

<p>“Well, he is, anyhow ... and what we’re going to
do with him to-day with you in bed ... it’s very odd,
every time you invite any one down who isn’t your
precious Hugh Mallam or one of your other cronies
you seem to catch a cold. Poor Dick, you won’t be
able to play golf to-morrow!” and with this parting
thrust the Doña left the room.</p>

<p>But Dick was too comfortable to be more than
momentarily ruffled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>There he lay: bathed, shaved, and wrapped in an
old padded dressing-jacket of the Doña’s (sky-blue,
embroidered in pink flowers), which he had surreptitiously
rescued from a jumble sale, against his own colds.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bed snored ’Snice, at his elbow
stood a siphon and a long glass into which four or
five oranges had been squeezed, and before him lay a
delicious day—no Church (“I say, Dick! That’s the
treat that <i>never</i> palls!” Hugh Mallam used to say),
an excellent luncheon brought up on a tray, then a
sleep, then tea, then, say, a game of Bézique with little
Anna ... but the best thing of all that awaited him
was a romance of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>He put on his eyeglasses and glanced through the
headings of the chapters: <i>Mr. ?</i>; <i>A Little Dinner at
the Savoy</i>; <i>The Freckled Gentleman Takes a Hand</i>;
<i>Double Bluff</i>.</p>

<p>Yes; it promised well. It was always a good sign
if the chapters took their headings from the language
of Poker.</p>

<p>With a little sigh of content he began to read. Had
he but known it, it was a most suitable exercise for a
Sunday morning; for, in the true sense of the word, it
was a profoundly religious book.</p>

<p>On and on he read.</p>

<p>The bedroom, unused to denizens at midday, seemed,
in its exquisite orderliness, frozen into a sedate reserve.
The tide of life had left it very clean and glistening and
still: not a breath rustled the pink cretonne curtains;
the autumn roses in a bowl on the dressing-table might
have been made of alabaster; the ornaments on the
mantelpiece stood shoulder to shoulder without a
smile at their own incongruity—a small plaster cast of
Montañes’ <i>Jesùs del Gran Poder</i> beside a green china
pig with a slit in its back, which had once held the
savings of the little Lanes; with an equal lack of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
self-consciousness, an enlarged photograph of Arnold
straddling in the pads of a wicket-keeper hung on the
wall beside an engraving in which the Virgin, poised
in mid-air, was squeezing from her breast a stream of
luminous milk into the mouth of a kneeling monk;
and everywhere—from among the scent-bottles on the
dressing-table, beside a chromograph of Cadiz on the
wall—everywhere smiled the lovely face of Pepa.</p>

<p>’Snice stirred at his feet, and, laying down his book,
Dick dragged his smooth, brown, unresisting length to
the top of the bed.</p>

<p>A member of his Club, who was an eminent physician
was always talking about the importance of “relaxing.”
“Pity he can’t see ’Snice,” thought Dick, as he lifted
one of the limp paws, then, letting go, watched it
heavily flop down on to the counterpane. “’Snice!
’Snice!” he repeated to himself; and then began to
chuckle, as, for the thousandth time, he realised the
humour of the name.</p>

<p>“’Snice,” meaning “it’s nice,” had been the catch-word
at the Pantomime one year; and Arnold or
Concha or some one had decided that that was what
Fritz, as he was then called, was constantly trying to
say; so, in time, ’Snice had become his name.</p>

<p>Yes, they certainly were very amusing, his children;
he very much enjoyed their jokes. But recently it had
been borne in upon him that they did not care so very
much about his. He often felt <i>de trop</i> in the billiard-room—his
own billiard-room; especially when Arnold
was at home.</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered how bored he and Hugh
Mallam used to be by his own father’s jokes—or,
rather, puns; and those quotations of his! Certain
words or situations would produce automatically
certain quotations; for instance, if his austere and ill-favoured
wife or daughter revoked at Whist, it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
be, “When lovely woman stoops to folly!” And,
unfortunately, his partner’s surname was Hope; unfortunately,
because every time one of them said,
“Mr. Hope told me so,” it would be, “Hope told a
flattering tale.”</p>

<p>But surely he, Dick, wasn’t as tedious as that? He
rarely made a pun, and never a quotation; nevertheless,
he did not seem to amuse his children.</p>

<p>Good Lord! He would be fifty-seven his next birthday—the
age his father was when he died. It seemed
incredible that he, “Little Dickie,” should be the age
of his own father.</p>

<p>Damn them! Damn them! He didn’t <i>feel</i> old—and
that was the only thing that mattered.</p>

<p>He stuck out his chin obstinately, put on his eyeglasses
again, and, returning to his novel, was very
soon identified, once more, with the hero, and hence—inviolate,
immortal, taboo. Whether hiding in the
bracken, or lurking, disguised, in low taverns of Berlin,
what had he to fear? For how could revolvers,
Delilahs, aeroplanes, all the cunning of Hell or the
Wilhelm Strasse, prevail against one who is knit from
the indestructible stuff of shadows and the dreams of a
million generations? He belonged to that shadowy
Brotherhood who, before Sir Walter had given them
names and clothed them in flesh, had hunted the red
deer, and followed green ladies, in the Borderland—not
of England and Scotland, but of myth and poetry.
As Hercules, he had fought the elements; as Mithras,
he had hidden among the signs of the Zodiac; as
Osiris, he had risen from the dead.</p>

<p>No; the hero of these romances cannot fall, for if
he fell the stars would fall with him, the corn would not
grow, the vines would wither, and the race of man
would become extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Rory Dundas, being a capricious young man, devoted
himself, that morning, not to Concha, but to Anna and
Jasper.</p>

<p>After he had been taken to scratch the backs of the
pigs, and to eat plums in the orchard, Anna proposed a
game of clock-golf.</p>

<p>“Are you coming to play?” they called out from the
lawn to Concha, Arnold, and David, who were sitting
in the loggia.</p>

<p>“No, we’re not!” called back Arnold.</p>

<p>Concha would have liked very much to have gone;
first, because it seemed a pity to have incurred for
nothing Teresa’s stare and the Doña’s raised eyebrows;
second, because she had been finding it uphill work to
keep Arnold civil, and David in the conversation. But
her childhood’s habit of docility to Arnold had become
automatic, so she sat on in the loggia.</p>

<p>“I think, maybe, I’ll go and try my hand ...
they seem nice wee kiddies,” said David, and he got up,
in his slow, deliberate way, and strolled off towards
the party on the lawn.</p>

<p>“Kiddies!” exclaimed Arnold in a voice of disgust,
when he was out of ear-shot. “The Scotch always
seem to use the wrong slang.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting as fussy as Teresa,” laughed Concha.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it comes to that, she needn’t think she’s the
only person with a sense of language. What’s the
matter with her? Each time I come down she seems
more damned superior. Who does she think she is?
She’s reached the point of being dumb with superiorness,
next she’ll go blind with it, then she’ll die of it,”
and, frowning heavily, he began to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>His bitterness against Teresa dated from the days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
before the War when he used to write poetry. He had
once read her some of his poems, and she, being younger
and more brutal than she was now, had exclaimed,
“But, Arnold, they’re absolutely dead! They’re decomposing
with deadness.” He had never forgiven her.</p>

<p>“I suppose she gives you a pretty thin time, doesn’t
she? She <i>does</i> hate you!”</p>

<p>Concha blushed. An unexpected trait in Concha
was an inordinate vanity—the idea that any one, child,
dog, boring old woman, could possibly dislike her was
too humiliating to be admitted—and though one part
of her was fully aware that she irritated, nay, jarred
æsthetically upon Teresa, the other part of her obstinately,
angrily, denied it.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if she does ... besides she doesn’t
... really,” she said hotly.</p>

<p>She then chose a cigarette, placed it in a very long
amber holder, lit it, and began to smoke it with an
air of intense sensuous enjoyment. Concha was still
half playing at being grown up, and one of the things
about her that irritated Teresa was that she was apt
to walk and talk, to pour out tea, and smoke cigarettes,
like an English actress in a drawing-room play, never
quite losing her “stagyness.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where the shoe pinches?” asked
Arnold. “It’s that you are six years younger than
she is; if it were less or more it would be all right—but
<i>six</i> years is jolly hard to forgive. You see, Teresa is
still nominally a girl. By Jove!” and he gave a
short, scornful laugh, “there she is, probably telling
herself that you get on her nerves because you’re frivolous,
and like rag-time, and all the rest of it, while all
the time she, the immaculate, is just suffering from
suppressed sex, like any other spinster.”</p>

<p>This explanation definitely jarred on Concha: she,
too, suspected Teresa of being jealous of her, but deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
down she hoped that this jealousy was based on something
less fortuitous and more flattering to herself than
six years’ juniority; nor did she like being thought of as
a mere frivolous “fox-trotter.” She had the tremendous
pride of generation of the post-War adolescent; she and
her friends she felt as a brilliant, insolent triumphant
sodality, free, wise, invincible, who, having tasted of
the fruit of the seven symbolic trees of Paradise, and
having found their flavour insipid, had chosen, with
their bold, rather weary eyes wide open, to expend
their magnificent talents on fox-trots, <i>revues</i>, and
dalliance, to turn life and its treacherous possibilities
into a Platonic <i>kermis</i>—oh, it was maddening of Teresa
not to see this, to persist in thinking of them as frivolous,
commonplace, rather vulgar young mediocrities! She
should just hear some of the midnight talks between
Concha and her friend, Elfrida Penn ... the passion,
the satire, the profundity!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these talks were mainly of young
men, chiffons, the doings of their other schoolfellows,
what their head mistress had said to them on such
and such an occasion at school, with an occasional
interjection of, “Oh, it’s all <i>beastly</i>!” or a wondering
whether twenty years hence they would be very dull
and stout, and whether they would still be friends.</p>

<p>But midnight talks are apt to acquire in retrospect a
great profundity and significance.</p>

<p>Also, the crudeness of Arnold’s words—“suppressed
sex, like any other spinster”—shocked her in spite of
herself. Her old, child’s veneration for Teresa lived
on side by side with her new conviction that she was
<i>passée</i>, out-of-date, pre-War, and it made her wince
that she should be explained by nasty, Freudian
theories.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! I’m sick of it all!” she cried with
exaggerated vehemence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“Sick of what?”</p>

<p>“<i>This.</i>”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s pretty difficult at home now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know it’s never been the same since
Pepa died.”</p>

<p>This time it was Arnold that winced; he could not
yet bear to hear Pepa mentioned.</p>

<p>“It’s made the Doña a fanatic,” Concha continued,
“and she never was that before, you know. Who was
it? Teresa, or some one, said that English ivy had
grown round Peter’s rock, and birds had made their
nest in it ... <i>before</i>. But now she’s absolutely
rampantly Catholic ... you know, she wants to
dedicate the house to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and
have little squares of stuff embroidered with it nailed
on all the doors....”</p>

<p>“<i>Good Lord!</i>”</p>

<p>“But, of course, Dad won’t hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t quite see what it’s got to do with
<i>him</i>—if it makes her happier,” and his voice became
suddenly aggressive.</p>

<p>“And she’d do anything on earth to prevent either of
us marrying a Protestant ... after all, what do-o-oes
it all matter? Lord, what fools these mortals be!”</p>

<p>And Concha, who, for a few moments, had been
completely natural, once more turned into an English
actress in a drawing-room play.</p>

<p>“Um ... yes ...” said Arnold meditatively,
sighing, and knocking out the ashes of his pipe.</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” she suddenly drawled, as a plump, grinning,
round-faced, young man made his appearance on
the loggia.</p>

<p>It was Eben Moore, son of the vicar and senior
“snotty” on one of His Majesty’s ships.</p>

<p>As to his name—it was short for Ebenezer, which,
as Mrs. Moore continually told one, “has always been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
a name in my husband’s family.... My husband,
you know, is the youngest son of a youngest son,” she
would add with a humorously wry smile, as if there
was something at once glorious and regrettable in
belonging to the Tribe of Benjamin.</p>

<p>His face perceptibly fell as he caught sight of the
two personable men playing clock-golf on the lawn.</p>

<p>“Aow lor’! You didn’t tell me as what there was
company,” he said, imitating the local accent.</p>

<p>“Good God!” muttered Arnold, who found Eben’s
humour nauseating; and he slouched off to join Guy,
who was writing letters in the billiard-room.</p>

<p>“Got it?” said Concha, stretching out her hand
and looking at him through her eyelashes.</p>

<p>Eben giggled. “I say! It’s pretty hot stuff, you
know.”</p>

<p>“E-e-eben! Don’t be a fool; hand it over.”</p>

<p>Eben, grinning from ear to ear, took a sealed envelope
out of his pocket and gave it to her, and having opened
it, she began to read its contents with little squirts of
laughter.</p>

<p>From time immemorial, young ladies have had a
fancy for exercising their calligraphy and taste in copying
elegant extracts into an album; for instance,
there is a Chinese novel, translated by an abbé of the
eighteenth century, which tells of ladies who, all day
long, sat in pagodas, copying passages from the classics
in hands like the flight of a dragon. Harriet Smith,
too, had an album into which she and Emma copied
acrostics.</p>

<p>Concha owned to the same harmless weakness;
though the extracts copied into her album could perhaps
scarcely be qualified as “elegant”: there was, among
other things, an unpublished play by W. S. Gilbert—(“What
I love about our English humour—<i>Punch</i>,
and W. S. Gilbert—is that it never has anything ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
well, <i>questionable</i>,” Mrs. Moore would sometimes exclaim
to the Doña), Wilke’s <i>Essay on Woman</i>, and <i>Poor but
Honest</i>.</p>

<p>One day, Teresa, happening to come into Concha’s
room, had caught sight of the album, and asked if
she might look at it.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>do</i>, by all means,” Concha had drawled, partly
from defiance, partly from curiosity.</p>

<p>Impassively, Teresa had read it through; and then
had said, “I’d advise you to ask Arnold the next time
he’s in Cambridge to find you an old copy of Law’s
<i>Call to a Devout Life</i>—that man in the market-place
might have one—beautifully bound, if possible. Then
take out the pages and bind <i>this</i> in the cover.”</p>

<p>Concha had done so; and if she had been as relentless
an observer of Teresa as Teresa was of her, she might
have detected in what had just transpired a touch on
Teresa’s part of under-stated, nevertheless unmistakable,
<i>cabotinage</i>.</p>

<p>The contents of the sealed envelope, which was
causing her so much amusement, was a copy of the song,
<i>Clergymen’s Daughters</i> that on his last leave she had
persuaded Eben on his return to his ship to make for
her from the gun-room collection, and which he had
not on their previous meeting had an opportunity of
giving her.</p>

<p>But she was not aware that there are three current
versions of this song, corresponding to the X, the double
X, and triple X on the labels of whisky bottles, and that
it was only the double X strength that Eben had given
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>After luncheon most of them played Snooker, to the
accompaniment of the gramophone, Anna and Jasper
taking turns in changing the records.</p>

<p>Eben had hurt his hand, so he sat and talked to
Teresa on the sofa.</p>

<p>It was a fact that had always both puzzled and
annoyed her that he evidently enjoyed talking to her.</p>

<p>“Have you read Compton Mackenzie’s last?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Why would every one persist in talking to her about
books? And why did he not say, “the last Compton
Mackenzie?” She decided that his diction had been
influenced by frequenting his mother’s Women’s Institute
and hearing continually of “little Ernest, Mrs.
Brown’s second,” or “Mrs. Kett’s last.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend it to you—I’m not sure if it’s as good
as the others, though ... it’s funny, but I’m very
fastidious about novels; the only thing I really care
about is style—I’m a regular sensualist about fine
English.”</p>

<p>“Are you? Perhaps you will like this, then—‘I
remember Father Benson saying with his fascinating
little stutter: He has such a g-g-gorgeously multitudinous
mind’?”</p>

<p>Eben stared at her, quite at a loss as to what she was
talking about.</p>

<p>“It sounds ... it sounds topping. What is it from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite remember.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t fair, she decided. Because she happened
to date from the feeling of flatness and disgust
aroused in her by this sentence, read in a magazine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
years ago, the awakening in her of the power of distinguishing
between literature and journalism, it did
not follow that it was exceptionally frightful or that
other people ought to react to it in the same way that
she had. And yet, “gorgeous palaces,” “multitudinous,
seas incarnadine”—the words themselves were
beautiful enough in all conscience. Anyhow, it was
not Eben’s fault; though “a regular sensualist for fine
English....” Good God!</p>

<p>“Do you want <i>Hee—hee—Heeweeine Melodies</i>, or
<i>Way Down in Georgia</i>, or <i>Abide With Me</i>? Arnold!
Do you want <i>Hee-wee-ween Melodies</i>, or <i>Way Down in
Georgia</i>, or <i>Abide With Me</i>? Do say!” yelled Anna
from the gramophone.</p>

<p>“People are inclined to think that sailors don’t go
in for reading, and that sort of thing, but as a matter
of fact ... our Commander, for instance, has a topping
library, and all really good books—history mostly.”</p>

<p>Rows upon rows of those volumes, the paper of
which is so good, the margins so wide, but out of which,
if opened, one of the illustrations is certain to fall—Lady
Hamilton, or Ninon de l’Enclos, or Madame
Récamier; now Teresa knew who read these books.</p>

<p>“Silly Billy! Silly Billy! Silly Billy!” yelled
Anna and Jasper in chorus as Rory missed a straight
pot on the blue; it was their way of expressing genuine
friendliness to their playmate of the morning.</p>

<p>On and on went Eben’s voice; scratch, grate, scratch,
grate, went the gramophone.</p>

<p>The light began to grow colder and thinner.</p>

<p>“Snookered for a pint!”</p>

<p>“Be a sportsman now....”</p>

<p>“I say!... he’s <i>done</i> it!”</p>

<p>“I say, you’re a devil of a fellow, Munroe!”</p>

<p>The game ended and they put up their cues.</p>

<p>“Now then, you two, what are you up to? Anna,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
you’re a hard-hearted little thing; why aren’t you
crying that I didn’t win?”</p>

<p>At which sally of Rory’s the children doubled up with
delighted laughter.</p>

<p>They all seemed to be feeling the tedium of the
period between luncheon and tea, and lolled listlessly
in chairs, or sat on the edge of the billiard-table, swinging
their legs.</p>

<p>“Anna, darling, put on one of the Hawaiian melodies—it’s
among those there, I’m sure,” said Concha.</p>

<p>After several false starts, and some scratchings of
the needle (it was Jasper’s turn to put on the record),
the hot-scented tune began to pervade the room.</p>

<p>“That’s the sort of tune that on hot nights must
have been played to Oberon by his little Indian catamite,”
said Guy, sitting down on the sofa beside Teresa.</p>

<p>She smiled a little absently; the Hawaiian melody
was like a frame, binding the room and its inmates into
a picture. Concha, her eyes fixed and dreamy; Rory,
intent on a puzzle—shaking little rolling pellets into
holes or something; Arnold sitting on the edge of the
billiard-table while Anna lit his pipe for him; Jasper
motionless, for once, his eyes fixed intently on the
needle of the gramophone; David standing by the door
gazing gravely at Concha, looking not unlike a Spanish
Knight who carries in his own veins more than a drop
of the Moorish blood that it is his holy mission to spill;
Eben standing by the fireplace, a broad grin on his
face, his hands on his hips, swaying slightly, in time with
the music ... what was it he was like? Teresa
suddenly remembered that it was the principal boy
in a little local pantomime they had all gone to one
Christmas—she evidently could not sing, because
during the choruses she would stand silent, grinning
and swaying as Eben was doing now.</p>

<p>The view was painted on the windows—a <i>pietà</i> as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
nobly coloured as that of Avignon; for, in spite of
flowers and fruits and sunshine, on the knees of the
earth the year lay dying.</p>

<p>Teresa was thinking, “The present frozen into the
past—that is art. At this moment things are looking
as if they were the past. That is why I am feeling as
if I were having an adventure—because the present
and the past have become one.”</p>

<p>Squeak! Burr! Gurr! went the gramophone.</p>

<p>“Stop it, Jasper! Stop it!”</p>

<p>“Beastly noise! It reminds me of the dentist.”</p>

<p>The record was removed.</p>

<p>“<i>Très entraînant</i>—as the deaf <i>bourgeoise</i> said after
having listened to the Dead March in <i>Saul</i>,” said Guy;
he had suddenly invented this Sam Wellerism in the
middle of the tune, and had hardly been able to wait
till the end to come out with it.</p>

<p>Then Anna put on a fox-trot, and Rory and Concha,
Arnold and Guy, in the narrow space between the
billiard-table and gramophone, hopped and wriggled
and jumped—one could not call it dancing.</p>

<p>“Now then, Munroe,” cried Rory, when it was over,
“You’re such hot stuff at billiards—let’s see what you
can do on the light fantastic.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, Mr. Munroe,” and Concha stood swaying
before him, flushed and provocative.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid ... I don’t ... well, if you’ve got
a tango here ... I used to try my hand at it in Africa.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see ... put on the <i>Tango de Rêve</i>, Anna.
Got it?”</p>

<p>David hesitated a moment; then, as if coming to a
sudden resolution, he clasped her, and stood waiting
for the bar to end; then they began to dance, and
their souls seemed to leave their bodies, leaving them
empty to the tune, which gradually informed them
till they and it were one; a few short steps, then a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
breathless halt, a few more steps, another halt ...
then letting themselves go a little, then another halt;
their faces tense and mask-like ... truly a strange
dance, the Tango, speaking the broken, taciturn,
language of passion:</p>

<p>Grrr ... went the gramophone—the spell was
snapt.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried the audience, clapping; while
’Snice began to bark, and the children to jump up and
down and squeal.</p>

<p>“You dance <i>divinely</i>!” cried Concha, flushed and
laughing.</p>

<p>David blushed, frowned, muttered something inaudible,
and left the room.</p>

<p>They exchanged looks of surprise.</p>

<p>“Hot stuff!” said Rory; and they settled down to
desultory, frivolous, Anglo-Saxon chatter—not unlike
fox-trots, thought Teresa.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes, half mesmerised by the din of all
the voices talking together.</p>

<p>The talk, like a flight of birds, squeezed itself out
into a long thin line, compressed itself into a compact
phalanx, was now diagonal, now round, now square,
now all three at once, according to the relative position
of the talkers.</p>

<p>“Don’t you <i>love</i> Owen Nares? I love his English
so—I love the way he says, ‘I’m so <i>jolly</i> glad to meet
you.’” “I knew Middlesex would be first—it was
only poetic justice to Plum Warner.” “I don’t care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
a damn what the <i>Nation</i> or what the <i>New Statesman</i>
says—I happen to know....” “Of course, with
Jimmy Wilde it’s all grit and science—he ought to do
him in every time.” “Is it true that Leslie Henson
wears spectacles off the stage?” “How much do you
think I gave for it? <i>Thirty bob.</i> A jeweller I showed
it to in town said it was the very finest Baltic amber—you
see, I got it out there.” “I <i>know</i>! My cousin,
Guy’s brother, when he was going out to Tin-Sin thought
it would be nice to brighten up China, so he took out
an assortment of the merriest socks you ever saw in
your life, and when he was killed my aunt handed
them over to me, and I had ’em dyed black....”
“Very nayce, too!” “What are you saying about
socks? I wish to God some one would mend mine!”
“Well, <i>I</i> got a bit of amber in an old shop in Norwich....”
“He’s a priceless little man ... he
came out and amused us at the front.”</p>

<p>“Tea time!” said Arnold, looking at his watch
and yawning.</p>

<p>“Tea time!” the others echoed; and they all got up.</p>

<p>“But look here, Miss Concha,” said Rory, “if you
love Owen Nares so much, why not come up and see
him? It’s quite a good show ... you’ll look at <i>him</i>
and I’ll look at the lady—though you’ll probably have
the best of it. What do you think, Arnold? We
could dine first at the Berkeley or somewhere ...
well, look here, that’s settled; we must fix up a night.”</p>

<p>Teresa felt a sudden and, to her, most unusual
craving for the life that smells of lip-salve and powder,
where in bright, noisy restaurants “every shepherd tells
his tale ...” where “the beautiful Miss Brabazons”
laugh and dance and triumph eternally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>After tea they decided to go a walk, and escort Eben
part of his way home—a delightful plan, it seemed to
Anna, Jasper, and ’Snice; but to Anna and Jasper the
Doña said firmly, “No, my darlings; I want you.”</p>

<p>Their faces fell; they knew it meant what Nanny,
who was a Protestant, called “a Bible lesson from kind
Granny.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, the fact that these lessons were
opposed to the wishes—nay, to the express command—of
Dr. Sinclair, was powerless in deterring the Doña
from attempting to save her grandchildren’s souls;
and, even if she failed in the attempt, they should at
any rate not be found in the condition of criminal ignorance
of the children of one of Pepa’s friends who had
asked why there were always “big plus-signs” on the
tops of churches.</p>

<p>The Doña was not merely a Catholic; she was also
a Christian—that is to say, though she did not always
follow his precepts, she had an intense personal love of
Christ.</p>

<p>Besides the shadowy figure struggling towards “projection”
through the ritual of the Church’s year, there
are more concrete representations on which the Catholic
can feed his longings.</p>

<p>The Doña’s love of Christ dated from the first Seville
Holy Week that she could remember.</p>

<p>She had sat with her mother and her little brother,
Juanito, watching the <i>pasos</i> carried past on the shoulders
of the <i>cofradias</i> ... many a beautiful Virgin, velvet-clad,
pearl-hung, like Isabella the Catholic. Then had
come a group of more than life-sized figures—a young,
bearded man, his face as white as death and flecked
with blood, the veins of his hands as knotted as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
cords that bound them, surrounded by half a dozen
fiendish-looking men, fists clenched as if about to strike
him, some clutching stones in their upraised hands,
all with faces contorted with hatred.</p>

<p>“Look! Look! Who are these wicked men?”
cried Juanito.</p>

<p>“These are the Jews,” answered their mother.</p>

<p>“And who is the poor man?” asked the Doña.</p>

<p>“Jésus Christos.”</p>

<p>Juanito, his little fists clenched, was all for flying
at the plaster bullies; but the Doña was howling for
pity of the <i>pobre caballero</i>.</p>

<p>Then, at Christmas time in every church there was a
crèche in which lay the Infant Jesus, his small, waxen
hands stretched out in welcome, his face angelically
sweet.</p>

<p>Also; at different times, for instance, when the
Gospel was read in Spanish, during her preparation
for her first Communion, the abstract presentation of
the Liturgy had been supplemented with stories from
His life on earth, and quotations from His own words.</p>

<p>Indeed, the sources and nature of the Doña’s knowledge
of Jesus was not unlike that of some old peasant
woman of Palestine. The old woman, say, would, from
time to time, ride into Nazareth on her donkey, carrying
a basket of grapes and olives to sell in the market:
and perhaps, if the basket should have fallen and
scattered the fruit, or if she had a pitcher to fill at the
fountain, she may have received a helping hand or a
kindly word from the gentlest and strangest-spoken
young man that had ever crossed her path.</p>

<p>Then one day she may have paid her first visit to
Jerusalem—perhaps a lawsuit over a boundary taking
her there, or the need to present her orphaned grandchild
in the Temple—and have seen this same young
man led through the streets, bound with cords, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the populace shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”
and have returned to her remote little farm with an ache
in her heart.</p>

<p>And, as the years would go by, from the tales of wayfarers,
from rumours blown from afar, she might come
to believe that somehow or other the young man had
died for the poor—for her; had died and risen again.
And gradually, as with the years his legend grew, she
would come to look upon him as a fairy-being, akin
to the old sanctities of the countryside, swelling her
grapes, plumping her olives, and keeping away locusts
and blight. But, towards the end of her life, business
may have taken her again to Nazareth, where, hearing
that the young man’s mother was still alive, something
may have compelled her to go and visit her. And
in the little room behind the carpenter’s shop, where
the other sons and grandsons were planing and sawing,
and singing to ancient melodies of the desert songs of
plenty and vengeance and the Messiah, the two old
women would talk together in hushed tones of Him who
so many years ago had been crucified and buried. And
through the mother’s anecdotes of His childhood and
tearful encomiums, “He was ever a good kind son to
me,”—the fairy-being would once more become human
and ponderable—the gentlest young man that had
ever crossed her path.</p>

<p>So far, the Doña had not been very successful in
bringing Anna and Jasper to their Lord.</p>

<p>For instance, when she had told them the story of
Christ among the doctors, Anna had merely remarked
coldly and reprovingly, “He must have been a very
goody-goody, grown-uppish sort of boy.”</p>

<p>This particular evening the Doña had decided to
consecrate to an exegesis of the doctrine of Transsubstantiation.</p>

<p>When the Doña said that at a certain point of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
mass the bread turned to the actual flesh and blood
and bones of Jesus, Anna’s face assumed an expression
of dogged scepticism, and having decided that she
must ask Teresa about it, continued her own thoughts:
Mamselle, who gave her French lessons in Cambridge,
had fired her imagination with accounts of the <i>bouktis</i>
they used to have in the Surbiton family where she was
once governess—“<i>vraiment, c’était passionant; je me
demande pourquoi Dr. Sinclair n’organise pas des bouktis
à Trinité—ça serait très amusant pour les jeunes
gens</i>....” It <i>was</i> a good idea! All the people with
buried names of books, and having to guess. Oh,
yes!... one could go with a lot of little lambs’ tails
sewed on one’s frock ... yes, but how was one going
to get in the “<i>of Shakespeare</i>”.... <i>Of course</i> ...
what a goose she was not to have realised it
before ... <i>bouktis</i> was Mamselle’s way of saying
“book-teas” ... that’s what the parties were
called—“book-teas.”</p>

<p>Thus Anna; as to Jasper—if one could reduce the
instantaneous and fantastic picture produced on his
mind to a definite consecutive statement, it would read
something like this: By the powerful spells of a clergyman,
who was also a magician, pieces of bread were
turned into tiny men—long-robed, bearded, and wearing
golden straw hats of which nothing but the brim could
be seen from in front. Then the clergyman distributed
to every one at the party one of the tiny men, to be
their very own. They each, forthwith, swallowed their
tiny man, and he made himself a little nest in their
stomachs, whence he could be summoned to be played
with whenever they liked.</p>

<p>He began jumping up and down, his body trembling
like that of an excited terrier.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want, I want, I want some of that bread,” he
cried. “Oh, when can I have it, Doña? Oh, I can’t wait!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Needless to say, the Doña was not in the least taken
in—she did not take it for a sign of Grace, nor did it
seem to her in the least touching; but she knew it
would strike Jollypot as being both, and the picture she
foresaw that the incident would produce on her—that
of the innocent little pagan calling aloud to God for the
spiritual food that was his birthright—was one that the
Doña felt would be both soothing, and expressive of the
way in which she would have liked the incident to have
appeared to herself.</p>

<p>A perfect household of slaves would include a sentimentalist
and a cynic by means of whom the lord,
whatever his own temperament, could express vicariously
whatever interpretation of events was the one
that harmonised with his plans or mood of the moment.</p>

<p>It was as she expected; Jollypot’s eyes filled with
tears, and she murmured, “Poor little man! poor
little man!”</p>

<p>And she was long haunted by the starving cry of the
innocent, “I want that bread! I want that bread!”</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>The walkers set out in the direction of the view,
strolling in a bunch down the grass path between
the border.</p>

<p>“You know, I don’t really like these herbaceous
things—they aren’t tame. I like flowers you can make
a pet of, roses and violets and that sort of thing,” said
Rory, looking towards Teresa.</p>

<p>She did not meet his eye, feeling in no mood to feed
his vanity by sympathising with his fancies.</p>

<p>From the village to their right rang out the chimes
for evensong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“Would Mrs. Moore mind if you missed church,
Eben?” asked Concha.</p>

<p>“She would be <i>grieved</i>,” grinned Eben. “You see,
Lady Norton wasn’t there this morning, but she always
comes in the evening, and the mater wants her to see
my manly beauty.”</p>

<p>This remark, thought Teresa, showed a certain
acuteness and humour; but all Concha’s contemporaries
seemed to have these qualities, and yet, it meant so
little, existed side by side with such an absence of
serious emotion, such an ignoring of intellectual beauty,
such a—such a—such an un-Platonic turn of mind.
Probably every one in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries—country parsons, grocers’ apprentices, aldermen,
fine ladies—had only to take up a goose’s quill
and write as they talked to produce the most exquisite
prose: witness the translation of the Bible by a body
of obscure, and (considering the fatuity of some of
their mistranslations) half-witted, old divines. Perhaps
the collective consciousness of humanity was silently
capturing, one after the other, the outposts of the
intelligence, so that some day we should all share in a
flat and savourless communism of apprehension.</p>

<p>But then the English, as a whole, had lost the power
of writing automatically fine prose ... oh, it was not
worth bothering about!</p>

<p>When they got out of the grounds of Plasencia, they
broke up into couples and trios—Rory moving to one
side of Concha, David, his back looking rather dogged,
to the other. Arnold had forgotten his distaste for
Eben in a heated discussion of the battle of Jutland.
Teresa found herself walking with Guy.</p>

<p>To the right lay a field of stubble, ruddled with
poppies, and to the right of that a little belt of trees.
Teresa had long noticed how in autumn scarlet is the
oriflamme of the spectrum; for round it the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
colours rally at their gayest and most gallant. For
instance, the dull red roofs of the cluster of barns to
the right glowed like rubies, if one’s glance, before
resting on them, travelled through the poppy-shot
stubble; and, following the same route, her eye could
detect autumnal tints in the belt of trees, which otherwise
would have been imperceptible.</p>

<p>“How lovely poppies would be if they weren’t so
ubiquitous,” said Guy. “I always think of poppies
when I see all the Renoirs in the Rue de la Boétie in
Paris—every second shop’s a picture dealer, and they
all have at least two Renoirs in their window—dreams
of beauty if there weren’t so many of ’em. And yet,
I don’t know—that very exuberance, the feeling of an
exquisite, delicate, yet unexigeant flower springing up
in profusion in the lightest and poorest soil may be a
quality of their charm.”</p>

<p>Teresa said nothing; but her brows slightly contracted.</p>

<p>Now they were walking past one of the few fields
of barley that were still standing—all creamy and
steaming ... oh, dear, that simile of Guy’s, in one
of his poems, between a field of barley and a great
bowl of some American patent cereal on a poster
... at any moment there might appear on the sky
the gigantic, grinning face of the cereal-fiend, whose
sole function was to grin with anticipative greed, and
brandish a spoon on the point of being dipped into the
foaming, smoking brew ... disgusting; and maddening
that it should cling to her memory.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose long ago the Danes and Saxons
fought battles here; and the buried hatchet has turned
the wild flowers red ... or does iron in the soil turn
flowers blue?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said Teresa coldly.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As through the land at eve we went</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And plucked the ripened ears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My wife and I....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“My wife and I ... fell out ... how does it go?”</p>

<p>“Not like that, Guy,” said Teresa, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>Guy blushed to the roots of his yellow hair; he had
a secret handicap of which he was horribly ashamed—practically
no ear for rhythm; and it was partly the
lameness of his verses that had made him fall back on
a poetry that had neither rhyme nor rhythm.</p>

<p>When he was absent from Teresa—even during a few
hours—his idea of her would undergo a swift change;
though remaining aloof, she would turn into a wonderfully
sympathetic lady—remote, but not inaccessible;
a lady eminently suited to moving gracefully among
the Chippendale, coloured prints, and Queen Anne
lacquer of his dining-room in St. James’s Street; quite
at home, also, among the <i>art nègre</i> and modern French
pictures of his drawing-room; receiving his <i>mots</i> with
a whimsically affectionate smile; in society bringing
out all that was most brilliant in him—existing, in
short, merely for his own greater glory.</p>

<p>It took a very short absence from her—for instance,
the interval between dinner and breakfast the next
morning—for this idea of her to oust completely the
real one. Then he would see her again, and would
again be bruised and chilled by the haughty coldness
masked by her low, gentle voice, her many silences;
and the idea would be shattered; to come together
again the minute he was out of her presence.</p>

<p>“Of course! You <i>would</i> be incapable of appreciating
Tennyson,” he said angrily.</p>

<p>“Why? Because I venture to hint that your
version doesn’t scan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not only that,” he almost screamed; “it’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
really because you think it’s sentimental to quote
Tennyson. Can’t you see that simple, trite words like
these are the only ones suited to expressing the threadbare
yet exquisite emotion that one feels when one
walks through autumn fields on Sunday evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but why not make those simple, trite words
scan?... and look here, Guy,” she added with unusual
heat, “it seems to me perfectly absurd to admire
Tennyson and crab Wordsworth. It makes one wonder
if any of your literary tastes are sincere. Everything
you dislike in Wordsworth is in Tennyson too—only
in Tennyson the prosaicness and flatness, though it
may be better expressed, is infinitely more ignoble. I
simply don’t understand this attitude to Wordsworth—it
makes me think that all you care about is verbal
dexterity. I don’t believe you know what real poetry
means.”</p>

<p>Poor Guy! How could he know that her irritation
had really nothing to do with his attitude to Wordsworth,
that, in fact, he and his poetics were merely a
scapegoat?</p>

<p>Shattered and sick at heart, he felt that his fears of
the previous evening about Oscar Wilde and brilliance
had been ruthlessly confirmed.</p>

<p>She looked at him; he actually had tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I ... I seem to have lost my temper,” she said
apologetically, “but it was only ... I’ve got rather
a headache, as a matter of fact, and what you said
yesterday about Wordsworth has rankled—he’s my
favourite poet. And you know I belong in taste to an
older generation; I simply don’t understand modern
things. But, as a matter of fact, I often like your
poetry very much.”</p>

<p>This mollified him for the moment.</p>

<p>“I say!” he exclaimed suddenly, walking more
quickly, “other people seem to be quarrelling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>Sure enough: the trio ahead was standing still;
Concha’s lips were twitching and she was looking self-conscious;
Rory’s eyebrows were arched in surprise;
and David, glowering and thunderous, was standing
with clenched fists. As Teresa and Guy came up to
them he was saying fiercely: “... and I’m just sick
to death of lairds and that ... and if you want to
know, I’m heir-apparent to Munroe of Auchenballoch,”
and he laughed angrily.</p>

<p>“You’re a lucky chap then ... Auchenballoch
is a very fine place,” said Rory in an even voice.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” said Guy.</p>

<p>“I seem to have annoyed Mr. Munroe, quite unintentionally,”
answered Rory.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully, David blushed under his dark skin.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Teresa felt a sudden wave of intense sympathy for
David, and of equally intense annoyance against Rory;
he had, doubtless, been again babbling about his relations—“old
Lionel Fane,” “the beautiful Miss Brabazons,”
and the rest of them—that was boring enough,
in all conscience; but if, as was probably the case,
David had been left pointedly out of the conversation,
it would become, into the bargain, insulting.</p>

<p>And under his easy manners, Rory was so maddeningly
patronising—especially to David, with his, “I
say! Dashing fellah!” and, “Now then, Munroe,
let’s see what <i>you</i> can do.” But ... it was possible
that David’s irritation was primarily caused by far
more vital things. ’Snice there, lying on his back, his
tongue lolling out, his eyes glassy, completely unconscious
of the emotional storm raging above him,
would probably, if they could have been translated
into his own language, have understood David’s
feelings better than Teresa and sympathised with them
warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“I’m rather tired—do take me home, Mr. Munroe,”
said Teresa.</p>

<p>He looked at her gratefully.</p>

<p>For some minutes they walked in silence, both
embarrassed, Teresa turning over in her mind possible
conversational openings. “You have been in South
Africa, haven’t you?” “Do you play golf?”</p>

<p>But she could not get them out.</p>

<p>What she said finally was, “What did you mean
exactly last night when you said to my mother that in
times like the War one sees the star?”</p>

<p>“I mean the Star of Bethlehem—they’re seasons of
Epiphany,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But how do you mean exactly?”</p>

<p>“Just that ... the Manifestation of Christ to the
Gentiles.” He said the words slowly, with gusto, as if
to him they had not yet become threadbare. “There
were a lot of chaps converted to Catholicism during the
War,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Were you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He paused, and again they were silent. Then he
said, “I was brought up a Presbyterian, but I was
never interested in that, I didn’t think of religion at
all. But during the War there were several chaps that
were Catholics in my regiment, and I used sometimes
to go to mass with them, or benediction, because it was
quieter in there than anywhere else. Then their padre
began talking to me, and I saw that once you had taken
the plunge it was all shipshape and logical. But the
plunge was the thing—that seemed to me to take a lot
of nerve and faith.”</p>

<p>Again he paused, then went on in a lower voice,
“Well, it was a wee church, very old, in a village behind
the lines, and one day mass was being celebrated there,
and just after the Consecration the gas gong and klaxons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
sounded—that meant we had all to retire in double
quick time behind the gas zone. The priest wrapped up
the Host in the corporals and hurried off with the rest
of us. When the scare was over and he went back to
the church—<i>the corporals were soaked in blood</i>.”</p>

<p>The last words were said scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>Well, there was no Protestant nonsense here; this
was the Holy Mother herself in all her crudity.</p>

<p>Teresa had not the slightest idea what to say; and
decided that she had better say nothing at all.</p>

<p>Yes, but it was not the bleeding corporals, really,
that had done it. She remembered a curious experience
she had once had when waiting to be fetched home in
the car by her father from some Chelsea lodgings where
she had been spending a fortnight. Her box was
packed, she was all ready dressed for the drive; she
had nothing to do but to wait in a little valley sheltered
from Time, out of the beat of the Recording Angel,
her old activities switched off, her new activities not
yet switched on. Then the practical relation between
her and the shabby familiar furniture suddenly snapped,
and she looked at it with new eyes—the old basket-chair,
the horse-hair sofa, the little table on which was
an aspidistra in a pot—they were now merely arrangements
of planes and lines, and, as such, startlingly
significant. For the first time she was looking at them
æsthetically, and so novel was the sensation that it
felt like a mystical experience. The Beatific Vision
... may it not be this æsthetic vision turned on
spiritual formula? A shabby threadbare creed suddenly
seen as something simple, solid, monumental?
Tolstoy must have been reared on the Gospels; but
suddenly when he was already middle-aged he thought
he had made a discovery which would revolutionise
the world; and this was that one must love one’s
neighbour as oneself. It was merely that he had, so to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
speak for the first time seen the chairs and tables
æsthetically. Yes ... heliacal periods, when the
star becomes visible. Mr. Munroe had said that he had
never before thought about religion at all; and it was a
mere chance that the room in which he first saw the
tables and chairs should be hung with crucifixes and
Catholic prints.</p>

<p>The bells had stopped ringing for evensong, the sun
was very near setting. Caroline, the donkey, gave
tongue from the paddock of Plasencia—a long, drawn-out
wail prefacing a series of <i>ee-aws</i>.</p>

<p>“That means rain,” said David.</p>

<p>“Caroline sings nothing but Handel,” said Teresa,
“a long recitative before the <i>aria</i>.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds David looked puzzled, and then
threw back his head, and, for the first time since he
had been at Plasencia, laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“That’s offly good,” he cried.</p>

<p>But Caroline was not the only singer of Handel. As
they crossed the lawn, Jollypot could be heard singing
to the cottage piano in the old schoolroom, <i>For He
shall feed His flock like a Shepherd</i>.</p>

<p>Among the many traces of Protestantism that had
clung to her was a craving for hymns at dusk on
Sundays; but being debarred from <i>Hymns Ancient
and Modern</i> she had to fall back upon Handel.</p>

<p>And <i>He</i> shall <i>feed</i> His <i>flock</i> like a <i>she</i>-e-e-e-e-<i>perd</i>.</p>

<p>Her small, sweet voice, like the silver hammer of a
gnome, beat out the words of the prophet, to which
Handel’s sturdy melody—so square, so steady on its
feet—lent an almost insolent confidence.</p>

<p>And <i>He</i> shall <i>feed</i> His <i>flock</i> like a <i>she</i>-e-e-e-e-<i>perd</i>....</p>

<p>“Is that—is that the wee lady?” asked David,
gently.</p>

<p>Teresa nodded.</p>

<p>They stood still and listened; Teresa was smiling, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
little sadly: the old optimists, Isaiah and Handel, had
certainly succeeded in cozening Jollypot’s papa; for
on a living worth £200 a year and no private means
he had begotten seven daughters. Nevertheless, the
little voice went on unfalteringly.</p>

<p>And <i>He</i> shall <i>feed</i> His <i>flock</i> like a <i>she</i>-e-e-e-e-<i>perd</i>.</p>

<p>David glanced at the slim, graceful young woman
standing beside him, looking gentler than she usually
did, but still very remote.</p>

<p>She, and Jollypot’s singing, and the scent of roses,
and the great stretch behind them of Sabbath-hushed
English fields, brought back, somehow or other, one of
the emotions of his boyhood. Not being introspective,
he had never analysed it, but he knew that it was somehow
connected with a vague dissatisfaction with his
lot, and with a yearning for the “gentry,” and hence,
because when he was a boy he thought they were
the same thing, a yearning also for the English. He
remembered how badly he had had it one Sunday
morning when he had played truant from the service
in his father’s church, and had slunk into the “wee
Episcopalian chapel” in the grounds of the laird.
The castle had been let that summer to an English
judge and his family, and the judge’s “high-English”
voice, monotonous, refined, reading the lessons in a
sort of chant, pronouncing <i>when</i> as <i>wen</i>, and <i>poor</i> as
<i>paw</i>, had thrilled him as the dramatic reading of his
father had never done. Then some years later he had
slipped into evensong, and the glossy netted “bun”
at the nape of the neck of Miss Stewart (the laird’s
daughter), and her graceful genuflections at the name of
Jesus had thrilled him in the same way. Finally the
emotion had crystallised into dreams of a tall, kind,
exquisitely tidy lady, with a “high-English” voice and
a rippling laugh, sitting in a tent during the whole of a
June afternoon scoring at the English game of cricket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
... or at a school treat, standing tall and smiling, her
arms stretched out, her hands clasped in those of her
twin pillar, warbling:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oranges and lemons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sing the bells of St. Clement’s,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while under the roof of arms scampered the hot, excited
children.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was an emotion that gave him a strange,
sweet nausea.</p>

<p>As to Teresa; as if her mind had caught a reflection
from his, she was pondering the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The ancient English dower of inward happiness.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wordsworth mourned it as a thing of the past; but
had it ever been? Did Jollypot possess it? Who
could say. Certainly none of the rest of them did.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>David left early the next morning. Evidently from
him, too, Concha had received an invitation to a dinner
and a play, for as they said good-bye she said, “Well
then, Thursday, 16th, at the Savoy—it will be <i>divine</i>.”</p>

<p>Rory did not leave till after tea.</p>

<p>Teresa’s offer of sleeping, owing to the shortage of
rooms, in her father’s dressing-room during the week-end,
had been accepted, and Rory had been put into
her bedroom; when she went up to dress for dinner on
Monday night she had noticed, on going near the bed,
a smell which seemed familiar. Suddenly she realised
that it was the smell of Rory’s hair-wash—the housemaid
had actually forgotten to change the sheets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Teresa had flushed, and her heart had begun to beat
in an odd, fluttering way; but she went down to dinner
without ringing for the housemaid.</p>

<p>When she came up for the night the smell was still
there. She undressed, and stood for some seconds by
the bed, her eyes shut, her hands clenched; and then,
blushing crimson, all over her face and neck, and,
flinging on her dressing-gown, driven by some strange
instinct, she flew to Concha’s room.</p>

<p>Concha’s light was out. She walked up to the bed
and gently shaking her said, “Concha! Concha!
May I sleep with you? They’ve forgotten to change
the sheets on my bed.”</p>

<p>“Sheets? What sheets?” said Concha in a sleepy
voice.</p>

<p>“In my room ... you know Captain Dundas has
been sleeping there.”</p>

<p>“Poor darling, how filthy! Get in,” and Concha,
so as to leave room for her, rolled over to one side.</p>

<p>Τὸ συγγενές τοι δεινόν, close physical kinship is a mysterious
thing; for, however much they may think they
dislike each other, it nearly always entails what can
only be called a bodily affection between the members
it unites.</p>

<p>For instance, since Pepa’s death, Concha’s was the
only plate Teresa would not have shrunk from eating
off, Concha’s the only clothes she would not have shrunk
from wearing.</p>

<p>That night they fell asleep holding each other’s hands.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>The night that Teresa and Concha spent so affectionately
in the same bed had no effect on their relationship:
Concha continued flinging herself, angrily, violently,
against Teresa’s stony stare.</p>

<p>If they happened to be alone in the room when the
post arrived and there was a letter for Concha, she
would read it through with knit brows, exclaiming
under her breath the while; then she would re-read it
and, laying it down, would gaze into the fire, apparently
occupied with some grave problem of conduct; finally,
springing to her feet with an air of having taken a final
and irrevocable decision, she would violently tear up
the letter, and fling the fragments into the fire.</p>

<p>The letter would probably be from her friend, Elfrida
Penn, and may have contained some slight cause for
anxiety, as Elfrida was an hysterical young woman and
one apt to mismanage her love-affairs; but Teresa,
sitting staring at the comedy through half-closed eyes
with fascinated irritation, would be certain that the
letter contained nothing but an announcement of Paris
models, or the ticket for a charity ball.</p>

<p>Teresa felt like some one of presbyopic and astigmatic
sight, doomed to look fixedly all day long at a very
small object at very close quarters; and this feeling
reached an unusual degree of exacerbation on the day
that Concha went up to London to dine with Rory
Dundas. At seven o’clock she began to follow every
stage of her toilette; the bath cloudy with salts, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
bottle of which she was sure to have taken up in her
dressing-case; then the silk stockings drawn on—“oh
<i>damn</i> that Parker! She’s sent me a pair with a ladder”;
silk shift, stays, puffing out her hair, mouth full of gilt
hair-pins; again and again pressing the bell till the
chambermaid came to fasten up her gown; on with her
evening cloak and down into the hall where Rory would
be standing waiting in an overcoat, a folded-up opera
hat in his hand, his hair very sleek from that loathsome
stuff of his—“Hulloooah!” “Hulloa! Hulloa!
I say ... <i>some</i> frock!” and then all through dinner
endless topical jokes.</p>

<p>Oh it was unbearably humiliating ... and how she
longed for Pepa: “Teresa darling! You must be mad.
He really <i>isn’t</i> good enough, you know. I’m sure he
never opens a book, and I expect he’s disgustingly
bloodthirsty about the Germans. But if you really
like him we must arrange something—what a pity May-Week
is such a long way off.”</p>

<p>What <i>did</i> she see in him? He was completely without
intellectual distinction; he had a certain amount of
fancy, of course, but fancy was nothing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me where is Fancy bred?</div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><i>Not</i> in the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><i>Nor</i> in the head</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">nearly all young Englishmen had fancy—a fancy fed
by <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, and the goblin arabesques on
the cover of <i>Punch</i>; a certain romantic historical sense
too that thrills to <i>Puck of Pook’s Hill</i> and the <i>Three
Musketeers</i>—oh yes, and, unlike Frenchmen, they probably
all cherish a hope that never quite dies of one day
playing Anthony to some astonishingly provocative
lady—foreign probably, passionate and sophisticated as
the heroine of <i>Three Weeks</i>, mysterious as Rider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Haggard’s <i>She</i>. But all that is just part of the average
English outfit—national, ubiquitous, undistinguished,
like a sense of humour and the proverbial love of fair
play.</p>

<p>Yes; their minds were sterile, frivolous ... <i>un-Platonic</i>—that
was the word for expressing the lack
she felt in the emotional life of the Rorys, the Ebens,
and all the rest of that crew; un-Platonic, <i>because
they could not make myths</i>. For them the shoemaker
at his last, the potter at his wheel, the fishwives of
the market-place, new-born babies and dead men,
never suddenly grew transparent, allowing to glimmer
through them the contours of a stranger world.
For them Dionysus, whirling in his frantic dance, never
suddenly froze into the still cold marble of Apollo.</p>

<p>Concha came back from her outing uncommunicative
and rather cross. She was evidently irritated by the
unusual eagerness shown by the Doña with regard to
her coming dinner with David Munroe.</p>

<p class="tb">One day Anna tackled Teresa over the doctrine of
Transubstantiation.</p>

<p>“I’ve never believed in fairies and things,” she said,
“and this sounds much more untruer—<i>is</i> it true?”</p>

<p>Teresa looked at her square, sensible little face—though
without the humour, so ridiculously like Harry’s
in shape and expression—and her heart sank.</p>

<p>What <i>could</i> she say?</p>

<p>Einstein—Bergson—Unamuno ... their theories were
supposed to provide a loophole.</p>

<p>She began to mutter idiotically:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Una—muno—mena—mo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Catch a nigger by his toe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“But is it true?” persisted Anna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Darling, just give me a minute to think,” pleaded
Teresa; and she set about reviewing her own attitude
to her faith.</p>

<p>Whatever the confessors may say, Catholicism has
nothing to do with dogma ... no, no, that’s not quite
it, dogma is a very important element, but in spite of
not accepting it one can still be a Catholic. Catholicism
is a form of art; it arouses an æsthetic emotion—an
emotion of <i>ambivalence</i>; because like all great art it at
once repels and attracts. When people confronted her
with its intellectual absurdities, she felt as she did,
when, at an exhibition of modern painting, they exclaimed:
“but whoever saw hands like <i>that</i>?” or
“why hasn’t he given her a nose?”</p>

<p>Of course, this peculiar æsthetic emotion is not to be
found in every manifestation of Catholicism—it has to
be sought for; for instance, it is in the strange pages at
the beginning of Newman’s <i>Apologia</i>, where, in his
hushed emaciated English, he tells how, in his childhood
in a remote village, never having seen any of the insignia
of Rome, when dreaming over his lessons he would
cover the pages of his copy-books with rosaries and
sacred hearts. And, when sitting one evening in the
cemetery at the bottom of the hill on which stands
Siena, she had got the emotion very strongly from the
contrast between the lovely Tuscan country, the magnificently
poised city, the sinister black-cowled <i>confraternité</i>
that was winding down the hill, each member
carrying a lighted torch—between all this and the
cemetery itself where, among the wreaths of artificial
flowers, there was stuck up on each grave a cheap
photograph of the deceased in his or her horrible Sunday
finery, with a maudlin motto inscribed upon the frame.
In the contrast too in Seville between Holy Week, the
pageantry of which is organised by the parish priests—a
wooden platform, for instance, carried slowly through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the streets on which stands the august <i>Jesùs de la Muerte</i>
flanked by two huge lighted candles—and the Jesuit
procession a few days later, in which Virgins looking
like <i>ballerinas</i> and apostles holding guitars go simpering
past all covered with paper flowers. One can get it,
too, from reading the <i>Song of Solomon</i> in the terse Latin
of the Vulgate.</p>

<p>It is an art steeped in a noble classical tradition which
nevertheless makes unerringly for what, outside the vast
tolerance of art, would be considered vulgar and hideous—chromo-lithographs,
blood, mad nuns. This classical
tradition and this taste for the tawdry are for ever
pulling against each other, and it is just this conflict
that gives it, as art, its peculiar <i>cachet</i>.</p>

<p>This was all very fine; but it would not do for
Anna.</p>

<p>“Darling, do you think it matters about a thing being
true, as long as it’s ... and, anyway, what exactly do
we mean when we say a thing is true?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Anna fretfully,
“do <i>you</i> believe that the clergyman turns that bread
into Jesus Christ?”</p>

<p>After a second’s hesitation Teresa braced herself and
answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, Daddy doesn’t, I’m sure and,” Anna
lowered her voice, “I’m sure Mummie didn’t either.”</p>

<p>“Well, darling, you know no one is going to <i>force</i> you
to believe it—you can do exactly what you like about
it.”</p>

<p>Then Anna trotted off into the garden and Teresa sat
on, thinking.</p>

<p>How was she going to cope with Pepa’s children?</p>

<p>These counter-influences—Plasencia and Cambridge—one
continually undoing the work of the other, were so
very bad for them. Childhood was a difficult enough
time without that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>She remembered the agony of her own struggle to
free herself from the robe of Nessus, woven by suggestion,
heredity, and imperfectly functioning faculties;
was she yet free from the robe? Anyhow, it was better
now than in that awful world of childhood—a world,
as it were, at the bottom of the sea: airless, muted,
pervaded by a dim blue light through which her eyes
strained in vain to see the seaweeds and shells and
skulls in their true shape and colour; a world to which
noises from the bright windy land above would from
time to time come floating down, muffled and indistinct—voices
of newspaper boys shouting “Death of Mr.
Gladstone! Death of Mr. Gladstone!” Snatches of
tunes from <i>San Toy</i>; bells ringing for the relief of
Mafeking.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>September turned into October; the apples grew
redder and the fields—the corn and barley gradually
being carted away to be stacked in barns—grew plainer,
severe expanses of a uniform buff colour, suggesting to
Teresa the background of a portrait by Velasquez.</p>

<p>The children were going back to Cambridge; and
their excitement at the prospect might have convinced
the Doña, had she been open to conviction, that their
life there was not an unhappy one.</p>

<p>They were sorry to leave the Doña and Teresa and
’Snice and the garden—that went without saying; but
the prospect of a railway journey was sufficient to put
Jasper, who never looked very far ahead, into a state
of the wildest excitement, and the occasional nip in the
air during the past week had given Anna an appetite for
the almost forgotten joys of lessons, Girl-Guides, the
“committee” organised by a very grand friend of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
twelve for collecting money for the <i>Save the Children</i>
Fund (one was dubbed a member of the committee with
the President’s tennis-racket and then took terrible
oaths of secrecy), and soon Christmas drawing near,
when Nanny would take them down to brilliantly lighted
Boots, with its pleasant smell of leather and violet
powder, to choose their Christmas cards.</p>

<p>Teresa knew what she was feeling; it was a pleasant
thought, all the small creatures hurrying eagerly back
from sea or hills or valleys all over the kingdom—tiny
Esquimaux swarming back from their isolated summer
fisheries to the civic life of winter with its endless small
activities, so ridiculous to the outside world, so solemn,
and so terribly important, to themselves.</p>

<p class="tb">Shortly after they had reached Cambridge Teresa got
the following letter from Harry Sinclair:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Teresa</span>,—Since his return from Plasencia
Jasper has been demanding a cake that turns into a
man.</p>

<p>“At first I supposed I had told him about those gingerbread
dragoons that old Positivist Jackson used to bring
us when we were children at Hastings.</p>

<p>“I was mistaken.</p>

<p>“I discover from Anna what he wanted was ‘the true,
real, and substantial presence of the Body of our Lord
Jesus Christ, together with His Soul and Divinity, in
the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist.’</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Teresa, I won’t stand it. If I notice
any further morbid cravings in Jasper for water, bread,
wine, or oil, I shall stop his visits to Plasencia.</p>

<p>“It really is insufferable—and you know quite well
that Pepa would have objected as much as I do.</p>

<p class="center">“Yrs.</p>

<p class="right">“H. J. S.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>It only made Teresa laugh; she knew how Harry must
have enjoyed writing it—could see him jumping on to
his bicycle and hurrying down to the University Library
to verify in one of the books of the late Lord Acton the
definition of Transubstantiation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately she left it lying about; and it fell
into the hands of the Doña, whom Teresa found in the
act of reading it, with set face and compressed lips.</p>

<p>At the bottom of her heart the Doña attached as
little importance to it as Teresa had done: the fact of
its having been written to Teresa and not to herself
marked it as being nothing more than a harmless and half
facetious means of relieving his feelings; besides, she
knew that to sever all connection with Plasencia would
be too drastic a step—involving too many complications,
too many painful scenes—also, too dramatic a
step to be taken by Harry in cold blood.</p>

<p>But there are very few people who have the strength
and poise of intellect to resist, by an honest scrutiny of
facts, the exquisite pleasure of thinking themselves
despitefully used by their enemy—very few too who can
resist the pleasure of avenging this despiteful usage on a
third and, to the vulgar eye, quite innocent person.</p>

<p>The human soul requires for the play that is its hidden
life but a tiny cast; and to provide parts for its enormous
company it falls back upon the device of understudies,
six or seven sometimes to one part. When this is
properly understood the use of the scapegoat will seem
less unjust.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the Doña chose to pretend to herself that
she took Harry’s letter seriously; and Dick was chosen
as the scapegoat.</p>

<p>There is prevalent in Spain a system of barter with
the Deity, the contracts entered into being of the
following nature: If God (or the Virgin or Saint ...)
will make <i>Fulano</i> faithful to <i>Fulana</i>, <i>Fulana</i> will not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
enter a theatre for a month; <i>or</i> if God will bring little
Juanito safely through his operation for adenoids,
<i>Fulano</i> will try to love his mother-in-law.</p>

<p>As a result of Harry’s letter the Doña entered into
such a contract: her Maker was to ensure the ultimate
saving of her grandchildren’s souls; while her part of
the bargain affected Dick and, incidentally, was extremely
agreeable to herself.</p>

<p>In her bedroom an identical little comedy was enacted
on two separate nights. On its being repeated a third
time, Dick burst out angrily: “Oh, very well then ...
it’s a bit ... no one could say I bothered you much
nowadays.... I know—that damned priest has had
the impertinence to interfere in my affairs.... I
suppose ... I won’t ... <i>very</i> well, then!”</p>

<p>If it had not been dark he would have seen that the
Doña’s eyes were bright and shining with pleasure.</p>

<p>For hours he lay awake; a hotch-potch of old
grievances boiling and seething in his mind.</p>

<p>Always him, always him, giving in every time: that
summer years ago when he had given up golf and
Harlech to take them all to Cadiz instead—<i>very</i> few men
would have done that! And if they were going to a play
always letting one of the children choose what it was to be—and
jolly little gratitude he got for it all! <i>Jolly</i>
little! Snubbed here, ignored there ... glimpses he
had had of other homes came into his head: “hush,
dear, don’t worry father”; “now then, Smith, <i>hurry!
hurry!</i> The master must not be kept waiting”; “all
right, dear, all right, there’s <i>plenty</i> of time.... Gladys
dear, just run and fetch your father’s pipe.... Now,
Charlie, where’s father’s overcoat? Good-bye darling,
I’ll go to the Stores myself this morning and see about
it for you ... good-bye, dear, don’t tire yourself ...”
whereas here it was: “Well, Dick; I really don’t see
how you <i>can</i> have the car this morning—Arnold wants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
it and he’s so seldom here....” Arnold! Arnold!
Arnold! Oh what endless injustice that name conjured
up! Actually it was years since they had had Welsh
rarebit as a savoury because Arnold had once said the
smell made him feel sick ... and oh, the cruelty and
injustice on that birthday when the Doña with an indulgent
smile had asked him what he would like for dinner
(damn her impertinence—as if it wasn’t his own house
and his own food and his own money!), and he had
chosen ox-tail soup, sole, partridge, roly-poly and
marrow-bones—ox-tail soup had been “scrapped”
because Arnold didn’t like it, sole because they’d had
it the night before, roly-poly because Arnold said it
wasn’t a dinner-sweet. As to the marrow-bones—they
had not been “scrapped,” indeed, but as every
one knows, a dish of marrow-bones is a lottery,
and he, Dick, the Birthday King, had drawn a
blank—a hollow mockery, in which a tiny Gulliver
might have sat dry and safe, not a single drop of
grease falling on his wig or his broadcloth. But
Arnold’s had been a lordly bone, dropping at first
without persuasion two or three great blobs of semi-coagulated
amber, and then yielding to his proddings
the coyer treasures of its chinks and crannies,
what time he had cried triumphantly, “More toast,
please, Rendall!” And the Doña had watched him
with a touched and gratified smile, as if she were
witnessing for the first time the incidence of merit and
its deserts. And it was not merely that the unfilial
Arnold had wallowed in grease, not offering out of his
abundance one slim finger of sparsely besmeared toast
to his dry and yearning father, but the Doña had not
cast in his direction one glance of pity—and it was
his birthday, too!... <i>oh</i> that Arnold! Who was
it ... Harry or Guy ... anyway he had heard some
one saying that every father feels like a Frankenstein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
before a grown-up son ... well, not many of them had
as much cause as he had ... despised, snubbed whenever
he opened his mouth. Oh damn that Arnold!
In what did he consider his great superiority to lie?
Curious thing how his luck had always been so
bad: he had not got into the Fifteen at Rugby because
he had put his knee out—so he <i>said</i>; he had failed
to get a scholarship at Trinity because his coach had
given him the wrong text-book on constitutional
history—so he <i>said</i>; he had only got a second in his
tripos, because the Cambridge school of history was
beneath contempt—so he <i>said</i>. And then the War and
all the appalling fuss about him—really, one would
have thought he was fighting the Germans single-handed!
And Dick, creeping about with his tail between his legs
and being made to feel a criminal every time he smiled
or forgot for a second that Arnold was in the trenches
... and, anyhow, if he had been so wonderful, why
hadn’t he the V.C., or <i>at least</i> the Military Cross?</p>

<p><i>Arnold was a fraud</i> ... and a damned impertinent
one! Well, it was his mother’s fault ... mothers
were Bolsheviks, yes, <i>Bolsheviks</i>—by secret propaganda
begun in the nursery setting the members of a family
against their head. He was nothing to his children—<i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>Just for a second he got a whiff of the sweet, nauseating,
vertiginous, emotion he had experienced at the birth
of each of them in turn—an emotion rather like the
combined odours of <i>eau de Cologne</i> and chloroform; an
emotion which, like all the most poignant ones, had a
strong flavouring of sadism; for it sprang from the
strange fierce pleasure of knowing that the body he
loved was being tortured to bear his children.</p>

<p>Yes, he had loved her ... there had been times ...
well, was he going to put up with it for ever? <i>Oh</i>, how
badly he had been used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Then it would all begin over again.</p>

<p>Finally he came to a resolution, the daring of which
(such is the force of habit) half frightened him, while it
made <i>his</i> eyes in their turn bright and shining with
pleasure.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The fire of October, which had first been kindled in
a crimson semicircle of beeches burning through a
blanket of mist on the outskirts of Plasencia, spread, a
slow contagion, over all the land. The birch saplings
in the garden became the colour of bracken. The border
was gold and amethyst with chrysanthemums and
Michaelmas daisies. And in the fields there lingered
poppies, which of all flowers look the frailest, yet which
are the last to go.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly, the breach widened between Teresa and
Concha; Concha had now completely given up pretending
that their relationship was an affectionate one,
and they rarely spoke to each other.</p>

<p>It was evident, too, that the lack of harmony between
their parents, noticeable since Pepa’s death, had
recently become more pronounced.</p>

<p>Dick was often absent for days at a time; and one
day Teresa happening to go into the Doña’s morning-room
found her sitting on the sofa looking angry and
troubled, a letter on her lap. Teresa took the letter—the
Doña offering no protest—and read it. I was a
bill to Dick from a London jeweller for a string of pearls.
Puzzled, she looked questioningly at the Doña, who
merely shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class="tb">In the servant’s hall, too, there seemed to be discord,
rumours of which drifted upstairs <i>via</i> Parker the maid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Parker had a way of beginning in the middle, which
made her plot difficult to follow, but which perhaps had
a certain value as a method of expressing such irrational
things as the entanglement of primitive emotions. Her
stories were like this: “And she said: ‘see you don’t
get Minchin in the garden,’ and Mrs. Rudge said, ‘oh
then some one else’s name would be Walker’; and I
said, ‘if Dale hadn’t been killed in the War <i>he</i> would be
in your cottage and that’s what the War has done for
<i>you</i>!’ and I said, ‘you’ve children, Mrs. Rudge,’ I said,
‘and I hope it won’t come knocking at <i>your</i> door some
day,’ and Lily said, ‘trust Parker to be after an unmarried
man,’ and I said, ‘don’t be so rude, Lily, it’s
Nosey Parker yourself ... even though I don’t go to
chapel!’ That was one for Mrs. Rudge, you see:
oh, they’re a set of beauties!”</p>

<p>The previous head-gardener, Dale, for whom the
middle-aged Parker had had a <i>tendresse</i>, had been killed
in the War. She looked askance at his successor Rudge
for wearing dead men’s shoes, and for being that unpardonable
thing—a married man; and into the bargain
he was a dissenter. Then there was Minchin, the handsome
cowman, whom Dick was thinking of putting into
the garden....</p>

<p>It was all very complicated; but seeing that light is
sometimes thrown on the psychology of the hyper-civilised
by the researches of anthropologists among
Bantus and Red Indians, perhaps these tales of Parker
deserved a certain attention—at any rate, behind them
there loomed three tremendous forces: sex, religion
and the dead....</p>

<p class="tb">One day, to the surprise of every one but the Doña,
there arrived in time for dinner Dick’s dearest friend,
Hugh Mallam.</p>

<p>He was a huge shaggy creature, if possible, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
boyish than Dick. He and Dick were delighted at
seeing each other, for Hugh lived in Devonshire and
rarely came as far north as Plasencia, and all through
dinner plied each other with old jokes and old memories;
and from the roars of laughter that reached the drawing-room
after they had been left to themselves they were
evidently enjoying themselves extremely over their
port wine.</p>

<p>The next morning Teresa coming into the morning-room,
found the Doña and Hugh standing before the
fire, the Doña looking angry and scornful while Hugh,
in an instructive and slightly irritated voice, was saying:
“Sorry, Doña, but I <i>can’t</i> help it ... I can’t help
being the same sort of person with Dick that I’ve
always been ... it’s like that ... I know it’s very
wrong of him and all that, but I can’t help being the
same sort of person with him I’ve always been ...
I....”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Hugh, you’ve said that before. But do
you realise what a serious thing it is for me and the
children? You <i>seemed</i> very shocked and sympathetic
in your letter—for one thing, a family man simply can’t
afford to spend these sums; then there’s the scandal—so
bad for the business and Arnold ... and you
promised me yesterday....”</p>

<p>“I know, but I tell you, as soon as I saw old Dick I
knew that I couldn’t lecture him, one can’t change....
<i>I can’t help being the same sort of person with him I’ve
always been.</i> But I really am most awfully sorry about
it all—the old blackguard!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you hear that we are ruined, perhaps you’ll
be sorrier still.”</p>

<p>“That won’t happen—no tragedies ever happen to
any one who has anything to do with me—ha! ha!
They couldn’t, could they, Teresa? I’m much too——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said the Doña sharply, suddenly noticing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the presence of Teresa; and, with a look of extreme
relief, Hugh slunk through the French window into the
garden.</p>

<p>So the Doña had actually been trying to turn Hugh
into their father’s mentor! It was not like her; she
was much too wise not to know that the incorrigibly
frivolous Hugh was quite unsuited to the part.</p>

<p>Parallel with the infallible wisdom that is the fruit
of our own personal experience, there lie the waste
products of the world’s experience—facile generalisations,
<i>clichés</i>, and so on. Half the follies of mankind are due
to forming our actions along this line instead of along
the other. There, Dick and Hugh were not two human
beings, therefore unique and inimitable, but ‘old school
friends’—and to whose gentle pressure back to the
narrow way is one more likely to yield than to that of
an ‘old school friend’?</p>

<p>But the very fact of the wise Doña acquiescing in such
a stale fallacy, told of desperation and the clutching at
straws.</p>

<p>Of course, Hugh was perfectly right—the shape and
colour of his relationship with Dick had been fixed fifty
years ago at the dame’s school in Kensington, to spring
up unchanged all through the years at each fresh
meeting. They could not change it; why, you might
as well go and tell an oak that <i>this</i> spring it was to weave
its leaves on the loom of the elms.</p>

<p>He had been right, too, in saying there would be no
catastrophe. The fate of Pompeii—a sudden melodramatic
blotting out of little familiar things—would
never, she felt sure, overtake Plasencia. Things at
Plasencia happened very slowly, by means of a long
series of anticlimaxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>As they sat on the loggia that afternoon reading their
letters after tea, Concha suddenly exclaimed, “Well I’m
<i>blessed</i>!” and laying down her letter began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the Doña.</p>

<p>“It’s that excellent David Munroe!”</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“He writes to say that he’s chucking business and
everything, and is going at once into a seminary to
prepare for ordination—it seems too comical!”</p>

<p>The Doña’s expression was one of mingled disappointment
and interest; while Jollypot’s cheeks went pink
with excitement. They began to press Concha for
details.</p>

<p>As to Teresa—somehow or other it gave her a disagreeable
shock.</p>

<p>Of course, every year hundreds of young men all over
the world had a vocation, went to a seminary, and, in
due time, said their first mass—she ought to be used
to it; nevertheless, she felt there was something ...
something unnatural in the news: a young man who
had business connections with her father, and gave
Concha dinner at the Savoy, and danced to the gramophone—and
then, suddenly hearing this ... she got
the same impression that she did in Paris from a sudden
vision of the white ghostly minarets of the Sacré-Cœur,
doubtless beautiful in themselves, but incongruous in
design, and associations, and hence displeasing in that
gray-green, stucco, and admirably classical city.</p>

<p>The others drifted off to their various business, and
Teresa sat on, looking at the view.</p>

<p>It was one of these misty October days when every
landscape looks so magnificent, that, given pencil, brush,
and the power of copying what one sees, it almost seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
that any one, without going through the eclectic process
of creation, could paint a great picture. The colours
were blurred as if the intervening atmosphere were a
sheet of bad glass; and the relationship between the
old rose of ploughed fields, the yellow strips of mustard,
and the brighter gold and pink of the sunflowers,
chrysanthemums, and Michaelmas daisies in the border,
made one think of an oriental vase painted with dim
blossoms and butterflies in which is arranged a nosegay
of bright and freshly plucked flowers—the paintings on
the porcelain melting into the flowers, the flowers
vivifying the colours on the porcelain.</p>

<p>That is what the relationship between life and art
should be like, she thought, art the nosegay, life the
porcelain vase.</p>

<p>Life could not be shot on the wing—it must first be
frozen.... Myths that simplified and transposed so
that things became as the chairs and sofa had been that
day in her Chelsea lodgings ... heliacal periods ...
Apollo and Dionysus ... it was all the same thing.
If only she could find it, life at Plasencia had some
design, some plot ... yes, that was it—a <i>plot</i> that enlarged
and simplified things so that they could be seen.</p>

<p>What was life at Plasencia like? A motley hostile
company sailing together in a ship as in Cervantes’s
<i>Persiles</i>?</p>

<p>No; it still had roots; night and day it still stared
at the same view; externally, it was immobile. It was
more like a convent than a ship, an ill-matched company
forced to live together under one roof, which one and all
they long to leave.</p>

<p>A sense of discomfort came over her at the word
“convent”: long bare corridors hung with hideous
lithographs; hard cold beds; shrewish vulgar-tongued
bells summoning one to smoked fish; an insipid calligraphy;
“that by the intercession of Blessed Madeleine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Sophie Barat, Virgin, through her devotion to thy
Sacred Heart” ... it certainly had <i>ambivalence</i>—it
was the great Catholic art she had tried to define to
herself when confronted with doubting Anna; but it
was not Plasencia.</p>

<p>“Nunnery” was a better word, a compact warm word,
suggesting hives and the mysterious activities of bees
... it had an archaic ring too ... yes, art always
exists in the past (if not why is the present tense never
used?)—it is the present seen as the past.</p>

<p>A nunnery, then, long ago—Boccaccio’s Fiammetta,
as a full-blown carnation splits its calyx, her beauty
bursting through her novice’s habit, receiving in the
nunnery parlour all the amorous youth of Naples. And
yet it was not the same as if she had received them in
a boudoir of the world. The nunnery’s rule might be lax
but it remained a rule; and that, artistically, was of
very great value—vivid earthly passion seen against
the pale tracery of Laud, Nones, Vespers. And at
Plasencia too—out there in the view life was enacted
against a background of Hours: <i>ver</i>, <i>aetas</i>, <i>autumnus</i>,
<i>hiems</i>—to call them by their Latin names made them
at once liturgical.</p>

<p>A nunnery, long ago ... where? Not in Italy;
for that would be out of harmony with the colour scheme
of Plasencia—not so with Spain, from the stuff of which
they were knit, so many of them. A Spanish play
(because a play is the best vehicle for a plot) much more
brightly coloured than Plasencia, “Cherubimic,” as
manuscripts illuminated in very bright colours used to
be called ... the action not merely in Spain, but
in their own Seville ... Moorish Seville ... hence a
play, written like the letters to Queen Elizabeth from
eastern potentates, “on paper which doth smell most
fragrantly of camphor and ambergris, and the ink of
perfect musk.”</p>

<p>And the plot? Well, that was not yet visible; but
the forces behind it would be sex, religion, and the
dead.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>October turned into November. At first some belated
chrysanthemums, penstemmons, and gentians, kept the
flag of the border gallantly flying; then Rudge cut it
down to the bare wood of stalks a few inches high,
which showed between them the brown of the earth.</p>

<p>Out in the country, for a time, a pink and gold spray
of wild briar garlanded here and there the thorny
withered hedges; and then their only ornament became
the red breast of an occasional robin, his plump body
balanced on his thin hairy legs, which were like the
stalks of the tiny Cheshire pinks that one sees in rock
gardens.</p>

<p>Everywhere the earth was becoming depalliated and
self-coloured; and on one of her walks Teresa came upon
a pathetic heap of feathers.</p>

<p>In autumn the oriflamme of the spectrum had been
red; now it was blue—a corrugated iron roof, for
instance. And soon the whole land was wintry and blue;
a blue not of vegetation but of light, light, which lay in
hollows like patches of blue-bells, which glinted along
the wet surface of the high road, turning it into an azure
river upon which lay, like yellow fritillaries, the golden
dung dropped by calves led to market; and through the
golden birches the view, too, lay delicate and blue.</p>

<p>Then black and white days would come, when the
sun looked like the moon, and a group of trees like a
sketch in charcoal of a distant city.</p>

<p class="tb">There was nothing new at Plasencia: Dick still sulked
at meals; the Doña’s face was cold and set; Concha<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
was <i>distraite</i> and went a great deal to London; Parker
complained of the Rudges; only Jollypot and ’Snice
went their ways in an apparently unclouded serenity.</p>

<p>Teresa was absorbed by a weekly parcel of books from
the London Library; charming mediæval books in
that pretty state of decomposition when literature is
turning into history and has become self-coloured, the
words serving the double purpose of telling a tale
and of illuminating it with small brightly coloured
pictures, like the toys in the pack of Claudel’s Saint
Nicholas:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Of Seville she already knew enough to serve her purpose,
having several years before, during a winter she had
spent there with her mother’s sister, gone every morning
to the University to read in the public library; and, as
it contains but few books of later date than the eighteenth
century, she had read there many a quaint work
on the history and customs of old Seville. And, fascinated
by its persistent Moorish past, she had dipped a
little into the curious decorative grammar of the Arabs,
in which, so it seemed to her, infinitives, and participles,
and adjectives, are regarded as variations of an ever-recurring
design of leaf or scroll in a vast arabesque
adorning the walls of a mosque.</p>

<p>Looking over the notes she had made at that time,
under the heading <i>Spanish Chestnuts</i> she came upon
two little fables she had written on the model of the
Arab apologues which were circulated during the Middle
Ages all over Spain; and, with the dislike of waste that
is so often a characteristic of the artist, she decided that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
if it were possible, she would make use of them in the
unwritten play.</p>

<p>Like every other visitor to Seville she had been
haunted by that strange figure, more Moor than
Christian, Pedro the Cruel; for, materially and spiritually,
his impress is everywhere on the city—there are
streets that still bear the names of his Jewish concubines,
the popular ballads still sing of his justice, his cruelty,
and his tragic death; while his eternal monument is
the great Moorish palace of the Alcazar within whose
walls Charles-Quint himself, though his home was half
of Europe, remained ever an alien—it is still stained by
his blood, and in its garden, through the water of her
marble bath, the limbs of his love, Maria Padilla, still
gleam white to the moon.</p>

<p>So it was natural that she should fix upon his reign
as the period of the play; and hence, though she read
promiscuously the literature of the Middle Ages, her
focus was the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>All the same, she had qualms. Might she not “queer
her pitch” by all this reading? A sense of the Past
could not be distilled from a mass of antiquarian
details; it was just because the Present was so rank
with details that, by putting it in the Past, she was
trying to see it clean and new. A sense of the Past is
an emotion that is sudden, and swift, and perishable—a
flash of purple-red among dark trees and bracken as
one rushes past in a motor-car, and it is already half
a mile behind before one realises that it was rhododendrons
in full flower, and had one had time to explore
the park one would have found its acres of shade all
riddled with them, saturated with them. An impression
like this is not to hold or to bind. And yet ...
she had seen a picture by Monticelli, called <i>François I.
et les dames de sa cour</i>, of which the thick flakes of dark,
rich colour, if you but stood far enough away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
glimmered into dim shapes of ladies in flowered silks
and brocades, against a background of boscage clustering
round a figure both brave and satyr-like—the king.
Something dim and gleaming; fragmentary as De
Quincey’s dream.</p>

<p>“Often I used to see a crowd of ladies, and perhaps a
festival and dances. And I heard it said, or I said to
myself, ‘These are English ladies from the unhappy
time of Charles I.’ The ladies danced and looked as
lovely as the Court of George IV., yet I knew, even in
my dream, that they had been in the grave for nearly
two centuries.”</p>

<p><i>Yet I knew, even in my dream, that they had been in
the grave for nearly two centuries</i>—yes, that was it.
You must make your readers feel that they are having
a waking vision; and your words must be “lonely,”
like Virgil’s; they must be halting and fragmentary
and whispered.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she went on with her reading, and, as
though from among the many brasses of knights with
which is inset the aisle of some church, their thinly traced
outlines blurred and rubbed by time and countless
feet, one particular one were slowly to thicken to a
bas-relief, then swell into a statue in the round, then
come to life—gray eyes glittering through the vizor,
delicately chased armour clanking, the church echoing
to oaths in Norman-French,—so gradually from among
the flat, uniform, sleeping years of the Middle Ages did
the fourteenth century come to life in Teresa’s mind.</p>

<p>Beyond the Pyrenees it was a period of transition—faith
was on the wane. She found a symbol of the age
in Boccaccio’s vow made not at the shrine of a saint, but
at Virgil’s grave; not a vow to wear a hair-shirt or to
die fighting the Saracens, but to dedicate all his life to
the art of letters. And, when terrified by the message
from the death-bed of Blessed Pietro Pietroni, he came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
near to breaking his vow and falling backwards into
the shadows, in the humane sanity of Petrarch’s letter—making
rhetoric harsh and mysticism vulgar—she heard
the unmistakable note of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>And in France, too, the writer of the second part of the
<i>Roman de la Rose</i> has earned the title of “le Voltaire du
moyen age.”</p>

<p>But on the other side of the Pyrenees the echo of this
new spirit was but very faint.</p>

<p>Shut in between the rock of Gibraltar and by these
same Pyrenees sits Our Lady of the Rocks, Faith ...
alone; for heresies (Calvinism being the great exception)
are, Teresa came to see, but the turning away of the
frailer sisters, Hope and Charity, from the petrifying stare
of their Gorgon but most beautiful sister.</p>

<p>But in those days, though as stern, she was a plainer
Faith. It was not till after the Council of Trent that
she developed the repellent beauty of a great picture:
the tortured conversion of St. Ignatius de Loyóla, the
Greco-esque visions of Santa Teresa de Jesùs, the
gloating grinning crowd in the <i>Zocodover</i> of Toledo lit
up by the flames of an auto-da-fé into one of the goblin
visions of Goya, were still but tiny seeds, broadcast and
sleeping. Catholicism had not yet lost the monumental
austerity of the primitive Church; its blazon
was still the Tree of the Fall and the Redemption
springing from Peter’s rock.</p>

<p>But, all the time, the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
woven by the “angelic doctor” round the Sacrifice of
the Mass, was slowly, surely coming to its own, and
Jehovah was turning into the Lord God of the Host.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Dr. Sinclair and the children, Guy, Rory, and, of course,
Arnold, were to spend Christmas at Plasencia.</p>

<p>By tea-time on the twenty-third they had all arrived
except Rory, who was motoring down from Aldershot
in his little “two-seater.”</p>

<p>Harry Sinclair, a big massive brown man, his fine head
covered with crisp curls, was standing on the hearth-rug
devouring hunks of iced cake and, completely
indifferent as to whether he had an audience or not, was,
in his own peculiar style—hesitating attacks, gropings
for the right word which, when found, were trumpeted,
bellowed, rather than uttered—delivering a lecture of
great wit and acumen.</p>

<p>The Doña and Arnold—he scowling heavily—were
talking in low tones on the outskirts of the circle; while
Dick would eye them from time to time uneasily from
his arm-chair.</p>

<p>The children—to celebrate their arrival—were having
tea in the drawing-room, and both were extremely
excited.</p>

<p>Anna’s passion for stamps was on the wane, and she no
longer dreamed of Lincoln’s album so bulgy that it would
not shut. She was now collecting the Waverley Novels
in a uniform edition of small volumes, bound in hard
green board and printed upon India paper; and following
some mysterious sequence of her own that had
nothing to do with chronology, she had “only got as
far as the <i>Talisman</i>.” She was wondering if there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
time before Christmas Day to convey to the Doña—very
delicately of course—in what directions her desires
now lay.</p>

<p>“The ... er ... chief merit of Shakespeare is that
he is so ... er ... admirably ... er ... <span class="smcap">prosaic</span>.
The qualities we call prosaic exist only in verse, and
<i>vice versa</i>....” (“How funny!” thought Anna, both
pleased and puzzled, “Daddy is talking about <i>Vice
Versa</i>.” She was herself just then in the middle of
Anstey’s <i>Vice Versa</i>.) “For instance ... er ... the
finest fragments of Sappho are ... er ... merely
an ... er ... <span class="smcap">unadorned statement of facts</span>!
Don’t you agree, Cust?”</p>

<p>This purely rhetorical appeal elicited from Guy a
shrieking summary of his own views on poetry; Harry’s
eyes roving the while restlessly over the room, while now
and then he gave an impatient grunt.</p>

<p>In the meantime tea and cake were going to Jasper’s
head. He began to wriggle in his chair, and pretend to
be a pig gobbling in a trough. As the grown-ups were
too occupied to pay any attention, it was Anna who had
to say: “Jasper! <i>Don’t</i> be silly.”</p>

<p>But he was not to be daunted by Anna; drawing one
finger down the side of his nose he squealed out in the
strange pronunciation he affected when over-excited:
“Play Miss Fyles-Smith come down my nose!” (Miss
Fyles-Smith, it may be remembered, was the “lady
professor” who sometimes worked with Dr. Sinclair.)</p>

<p>The Doña stopped suddenly in the middle of something
she was saying to Arnold, raised her <i>lorgnette</i>, and
looked at Harry; he was frowning, and, with an impatient
jerk of the head, turned again to Guy: “Well,
as I was saying, Cust....”</p>

<p>It might, of course, be interpreted quite simply as
merely momentarily irritation at the idiotic interruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“You see,” began Anna in laborious explanation,
“he pretends that there’s a real Miss Fyles-Smith and a
pretence one, and the pretence one is called ‘play Miss
Fyles-Smith,’ and whenever he gets silly he wants
people to come down his nose, and....”</p>

<p>Then there was a laugh in the hall, discreetly echoed
by Rendall the butler.</p>

<p>“Hallo! That’s Rory,” said Concha, and ran out
into the hall.</p>

<p>Teresa felt herself stiffening into an attitude of
hostile criticism.</p>

<p>“Here he is!”</p>

<p class="tb">First entry of the <i>jeune premier</i> in a musical play:</p>

<p>“Well, guuurls, here we are again,” while the Beauty
Chorus crowds round him and he chucks the prettiest
one under the chin. Then—bang! squeak! pop! goes
the orchestra and, running right up to the footlights,
the smirking chorus massed behind him, he begins half
singing, half speaking:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, at last it was over and he was sitting at a little
table eating muffins and blackberry jam.</p>

<p>“What have I been doing, Mrs. Lane? Oh, I’ve
been leading a blameless life,” and then he grinned and,
Teresa was convinced, <i>simultaneously</i> caught her eye,
the Doña’s, Concha’s, and Jollypot’s.</p>

<p>She remembered when they were children how on their
visits to the National Portrait Gallery, Jollypot used to
explain to them that the only test of a portrait’s having
been painted by a great master was whether the eyes
seemed simultaneously fixed upon every one in the room;
and they would all rush off to different corners of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
gallery, and the eyes would certainly follow every one
of them. The eyes of a male flirt have the same
mysterious ubiquity.</p>

<p>“I do think it’s most extraordinary good of you to
have me here for Christmas. I feel it’s frightful cheek
for such a new friend, but I simply hadn’t the strength
of mind to refuse—I <i>did</i> so want to come. I know
I <i>ought</i> to have gone up to Scotland, but my uncle really
much prefers having his goose to himself. He’s a sort
of Old Father William, you know, can eat it up beak
and all.... Yes, the shops <i>are</i> looking jolly. I got
stuck with the little car in a queue in Regent Street the
other day and I longed to jump out and smash the
windows and loot everything I saw. I say, Guy, you
ought to write a poem about Christmas shops....”</p>

<p>“Well, as a matter of fact, it <i>is</i> an amazing <i>flora</i>
and <i>fauna</i>,” cried Guy, moving away from Harry
and the fire: “Sucking pigs with oranges in their
mouths, toy giraffes ... and all these frocks—Redfern
mysteriously blossoming as though it were St. John’s
Eve, the wassail-bowl of Revell crowned with imitation
flowers....”</p>

<p>“Go it! Go it!” laughed Rory.</p>

<p>“Oh Rory, it was too priceless—do you remember
that exquisite <i>mannequin</i> at Revell’s, a lovely thing
with heavenly ankles? Well, the other day I was at
the Berkeley with Frida and ...” and Concha successfully
narrowed his attention into a channel of her own
digging.</p>

<p>What energy to dig channels, to be continually on the
alert, to fight!</p>

<p>Much better, like Horace’s arena-wearied gladiator,
to seek the <i>rudis</i> of dismissal.</p>

<p>The Doña made a little sign to Arnold, and they
both got up and left the room, Dick suspiciously following
them with his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>The talk and laughter like waves went on beating
round Teresa.</p>

<p>Now Guy was turning frantic glances towards her and
talking louder and more shrilly than usual—evidently
he thought he was saying something particularly
brilliant, and wanted her to hear it.</p>

<p>“Bergson seems to look upon the intellectuals as so
many half-witted old colonels, living in a sort of Bath,
at any rate a geometrical town—all squares and things,
and each square built by a philosopher or school of
thought: Berkeley Square, Russell Square, Oxford
Crescent....”</p>

<p>“Well, the War did one good thing, at any rate, it
silenced Bergson,” said Harry impatiently, “I don’t
think he has any influence now, but not being er ...
er ... a Fellow of <span class="smcap">King’s</span>, I’m not well up in what ...
er ... the <span class="smcap">young</span> are thinking.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, here <i>are</i> the young—you’d better ask ’em,”
chuckled Dick, since the departure of his wife and son,
once more quite natural and genial: “Anna, do you
read Bergson?”</p>

<p>“No!” she answered sulkily and a little scornfully—she
liked the “grown-ups” to pay her attention, but
not <i>that</i> sort of attention.</p>

<p>“There you are, Harry!” chuckled Dick triumphantly;
though what his cause was for triumph must
remain a mystery.</p>

<p>“Quite right, old thing! I don’t read him either—much
too deep for you and me. What <i>are</i> you
reading just now?” said Rory, beckoning her to his
side.</p>

<p>She at once became friendly again: “I’m reading
<i>Vice Versa</i>,” and she chuckled reminiscently, “And ...
I’ve just finished the <i>Talisman</i> ... and I’d like to read
<i>Kenilworth</i>.”</p>

<p>What a pity the Doña was not there to hear! But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
perhaps one of them would tell her what she had said,
and she would guess.</p>

<p>“Which do you like best, Richard Cœur de Lion or
Richard Bultitude?” asked Guy.</p>

<p>“<i>Richard</i> Bultitude!” laughed Rory scornfully, “Do
you hear that, Anna? He thinks the old buffer’s name
was Richard! But we know better; <i>we</i> know it was
Paul, don’t we?”</p>

<p>Anna would have liked to have shared with Rory an
appearance of superior knowledge; but honesty forced
her to say: “Oh but the little boy was Richard Bultitude—Dickie,
you know; his real name was Richard.”</p>

<p>“There, Rory! There!” shouted Guy triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that girl’s—I can’t remember her
name, that one that shoots a <i>billet-doux</i> at Mr. Bultitude
in church—well, her papa, the old boy that gave the
responses all wrong ‘in a loud confident voice,’ doesn’t
he remind you rather of Uncle Jimmy?” said Rory
to Guy.</p>

<p>“The best character in ... er ... that book is
the German master, who ... er ...” began Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh <i>yes</i>, a <i>heavenly</i> creature—‘I veel make a leetle
choke to agompany it’!” shrieked Concha.</p>

<p>“I hate Dulcie—I think she’s silly,” said Anna; but
no one was listening to her, they were launched upon a
“grown-up” discussion of <i>Vice Versa</i> that might last
them till it was time to dress for dinner ... a rosy
English company, red-mufflered, gaitered, bottle-green-coated,
with shrieks of laughter keeping the slide
“boiling” in the neighbourhood of Dingley Dell.</p>

<p>Teresa, as usual, sitting apart, felt in despair—what
could be done with such material? A ceaseless
shower of insignificant un-co-related events, and casual,
ephemeral talk ... she must not submit to the tyranny
of detail, the gluttony that wanted everything ... she
must mythologise, ruthlessly prune ... hacking away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
through the thick foliage of words, chopping off the
superfluous characters, so that at last the plot should
become visible.</p>

<p>Anna, rather resenting that what she looked upon as
a children’s book should be commandeered by the
grown-ups for their own silly talk in which she could
not share, went off to the billiard-room to play herself
tunes on the gramophone.</p>

<p>Jasper had long since sneaked off with ’Snice for a
second tea in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Then Guy left the group of Anstey amateurs and
came and sat down beside Teresa.</p>

<p>“Have you been reading anything?” he asked; and
without waiting for an answer, and slightly colouring,
he said eagerly: “I’ve been learning Spanish, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Do you like it?”</p>

<p>And that was all! How often had he rehearsed the
conversation, or, rather, the disquisition, that ought at
this point to have arisen: “Those who know the
delicate sophistication of <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> feel less
amazement when from an <i>Amadis</i>-pastoral Euphues-rotted
Europe an urbane yet compelling voice begins
very quietly: ‘In a village of la Mancha, the name of
which I do not care to recollect, there lived not long
ago a knight’....”</p>

<p>And surely she might have shown a little emotion—was
it not just a little touching that entirely for her sake
he should have taken the trouble to learn Spanish?</p>

<p>“Well, what have you been reading in Spanish—the
<i>Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i>?”</p>

<p>Though this was only a joke, he felt sore and nettled,
and said sulkily: “What’s that? I’ve never heard
of it.”</p>

<p>“You lie, Guy, you lie! You have heard of the <i>Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i>, and you have heard of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
<i>If Winter Comes</i>; because from what you tell me of
your parents they probably talk of both incessantly,
and....”</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, as a matter of fact,” laughed
Guy, delighted that she should remember what he had
told her about the manners and customs of his parents,
“they talked of nothing else at one time. It made
them feel that at last they were able to understand and
sympathise with what my generation was after. My
father began one night at dinner, ‘Very interesting book
that, Guy, <i>If Winter Comes</i>—very well written book,
very clever; curious book—painful though, painful!’
And my mother tried to discuss some one called Mabel’s
character with me. It was no good my saying I hadn’t
read it—it only made them despise me and think I
wasn’t <i>dans le mouvement</i>, after all.”</p>

<p>“There, you see!” laughed Teresa; “Well, what
<i>are</i> you reading in Spanish?”</p>

<p>“Calderon’s <i>Autos</i>,” and then he launched into one of
his excited breathless disquisitions: “As a matter of
fact, I was rather disappointed at first. I knew, of
course, that they were written in glorification of the
Eucharist and that they were bound to be symbolic,
and ‘flowery and starry,’ and all the rest of it—man
very tiny in comparison with the sun and the moon and
the stars and the Cross—but the unregenerate part of
me—I suppose it’s some old childhood’s complex—has
a secret craving for <i>genre</i>. Every fairy story I read
when I was a child was a disappointment till I came
upon Morris’s <i>Prose Romances</i>, and then at last I found
three dimensional knights and princesses, and a whole
fairy countryside where things went on happening even
when Morris and I weren’t looking at them: cows being
milked, horses being shod, lovers wandering in lanes;
and one knew every hill and every tree, and could take
the short cut from one village to another in the dark.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
And I’d hoped, secretly, that the <i>autos</i> were going to
be a little bit like that ... that the characters would
be at once abstractions—Grace, the Mosaic Law, and
so on—<i>and</i> at the same time real seventeenth century
Spaniards, as solid as Sancho Panza, gossiping in
taverns, and smelling of dung and garlic. But, of
course, I came to see that the real thing was infinitely
finer—the plays of a theologian, a priest who had
listened in the confessional to disembodied voices
whispering their sins, and who kept, like a bird in a
cage, a poet’s soul among the scholastic traditions of
his intellect, so that gothic decorations flower all round
the figure of Theology, as in some Spanish Cathedral ...”
he paused to take breath, and then added: “I say—I
thought you wouldn’t mind—but I’ve brought you
for Christmas an edition of the <i>Autos</i>—I think you’ll
like them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much, I should love to read
them,” said Teresa with unusual warmth.</p>

<p>She had been considerably excited by what he had
said. An <i>auto</i> that was at once realistic and allegorical—there
were possibilities in the idea.</p>

<p>She sat silent for a few seconds, thinking; and then
she became conscious of Harry’s voice holding forth on
some topic to the group round the fire: “... really
... er ... a ... er ... <span class="smcap">tragic</span> conflict. The one
thing that gave colour and ... er ... significance to
her drab spinsterhood was the conviction that these
experiences were supernatural. The spiritual communion
... the ... er ... er ... in fact the <span class="smcap">conversations</span>
with the invisible ‘Friend’ became more
and more frequent, and more and more ... er ...
<i>satisfying</i>, and indeed of nightly occurrence. Then she
happened to read a book by Freud or some one and ...
er ... <span class="smcap">the fat was in the fire</span>—or, rather, something
that undergoes a long period of smouldering before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
it breaks into flames was in the fire. Remember, she
was nearly fifty, and a Swiss Calvinist, but she had
really <i>remarkable</i> intellectual pluck. Slowly she began
to test her mystical experiences by the theories of
Freud and Co., and was forced in time to admit that
they sprang <i>entirely</i> from ... er ... suppressed ...
er ... er ... <span class="smcap">erotic</span> desires. I gather the modern
school of psychologists hold all so-called mystical
experiences <i>do</i>. Leuba said....”</p>

<p>Here Jollypot, who had been sitting in a corner with
her crochet, a silent listener, got up, very white and
wide-eyed, and left the room.</p>

<p>Teresa’s heart contracted. They were ruthless
creatures, that English fire-lit band—tearing up Innocence,
while its roots shrieked like those of a mandrake.</p>

<p>But she had got a sudden glimpse into the inner life
of Jollypot.</p>

<p>Then she too, left the room; as for once the talk had
been pregnant, and she wanted to think.</p>

<p>Sexual desires concealed under mystical experiences
... a Eucharistic play. Unamuno said that the
Eucharist owed its potency to the fact that it stood for
immortality, for life. But it was also, she realised,
the “bread not made of wheat,” therefore it must
stand for the man-made things as well—these vain yet
lovely yearnings that differentiate him from flowers
and beasts, and which are apt to run counter to the life
he shares with these. The Eucharist, then, could stand
either for life, the blind biological force, or for the enemy
of life—the dreams and shadows that haunt the soul
of man; the enemy of that blind biological force, yes,
but also its flower, because it grows out of it....</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The days of Christmas week passed in walks, dancing,
and talk in the billiard-room.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day Rory had given Concha a volume
of the Harrow songs with music, and to the Doña
an exquisite ivory hand-painted eighteenth-century
fan with which she was extremely pleased; indeed, to
Teresa’s surprise, he had managed to get into her good
graces, and they had started a little relationship of their
own consisting of mock gallantry on his side and good-natured
irony on hers.</p>

<p>As to Concha, she had taken complete possession of him
and seemed to know as much about his relations—“Uncle
Jimmy,” “old Lionel Fane” and the rest of
them—as he did himself; she knew, too, who had been
his fag at Harrow and the names of all his brother
officers; in fact, the sort of things that, hitherto, she
had only known about Arnold; and Arnold evidently
was not overpleased.</p>

<p>One day a little incident occurred in connection with
Arnold that touched Teresa very much. Happening to
want something out of her room she found its entry
barred by him and the Doña, she superintending, while
he was nailing on to the door a small piece of canvas
embroidered with the Sacred Heart of Jesus.</p>

<p>“We won’t be a minute,” said the Doña serenely;
and Arnold, scowling and rather red, silently finished his
job. By the end of the morning there was not a room
in the house that had not the Sacred Heart nailed on
its door. Dick being by this time too cowed to protest.</p>

<p>Teresa knew how Arnold must have loathed it; but
he evidently meant by his co-operation to make it clear
once and for all that he was on his mother’s side in the
present crisis as opposed to his father’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>In connection with the undercurrent of life at Plasencia,
another little scene is perhaps worth recording.</p>

<p>“By the way, Guy,” said Rory, one morning they
were sitting in the billiard-room, “How are Uncle Roger
and Aunt May getting on in Pau?”</p>

<p>“Oh, same old thing—mother plays croquet and goes
to the English Church, and father plays golf and goes
to the English Club. Sometimes they motor over to
Biarritz to lunch with friends—and that’s about all!”</p>

<p>“Well, and a jolly good life too! That’s how <i>I’ll</i>
spend the winter when I’m old, only I won’t go to Pau,
I’ll go to Nice—there’s a better casino. And what’s
more, I’ll drag <i>you</i> there, Guy. It would do him a lot
of good, wouldn’t it, Miss Lane?” and Rory grinned
at Teresa, who, staring at Guy critically through
narrowed eyes, said: “I don’t think he’ll need any
dragging. I can see him when he’s old—an extremely
<i>mondain</i> figure in white spats, constantly drinking tea
with duchesses, and writing his memoirs.”</p>

<p>Guy looked at her suspiciously—Mallock, certainly,
drank tea with duchesses and wrote his memoirs; not
a bad writer, Mallock! But probably Teresa despised
him; Swinburne had been a dapper <i>mondain</i> figure in
his youth—what did she mean exactly?</p>

<p>“Poor old Guy!” laughed Rory, “I can see him, too—a
crusty old Tory, very severe on the young and their
idiotic poetry.... I expect you’re a violent Socialist,
Miss Lane, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>Foolish, conventional young man, going round sticking
labels on every one! Well, so she was labelled “a
Socialist,” and that meant “high-browed,” and undesirable;
But why on earth did she mind?</p>

<p>Concha was looking at her with rather a curious little
smile. She sometimes had an uncomfortable feeling
that Concha was as good at reading <i>her</i> thoughts as she
was as reading Concha’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“She is a Socialist like you, isn’t she, Guy?” persisted
Rory.</p>

<p>“He means an intellectual character,” explained Guy,
not ill-pleased.</p>

<p>“No, but you do want to blow us all up, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Do I?” said Teresa coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I’m a Bolshevik myself, a revolution
would be my only chance of getting into the Guards.
‘Hell-for-leather Dundas of the Red Guards!’ It
sounds like a hero by ... that mad woman our
mothers knew in Florence, Guy—what was her name?...
Yes, like a hero in a Ouida novel.”</p>

<p>“Do I hear you say, Dundas, that you think yourself
like one of ... er ... Ouida’s heroes?” said Harry
Sinclair, coming in at that moment with Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, modesty forbids me to say so in so many
<i>words</i>,” grinned Rory.</p>

<p>“There used to be an aged don at Cambridge,” continued
Harry, “half-blind, wholly deaf, and with an
... er ... game ... <span class="smcap">leg</span>, and when he was asked to
what character in history he felt most akin he answered
... er ... er ‘<span class="allsmcap">ALCIBIADES</span>’!”</p>

<p>“That was old Potter, wasn’t it? I remember ...”
began Dick, but Concha interrupted him by exclaiming
eagerly: “What a good game! Let’s play it—history
or fiction, but we mustn’t say our own, we must guess
each other’s’—Rory is settled, he thinks himself like a
Ouida hero ...” and she suddenly broke off, turned
red, and looked at Teresa with that glazed opaque look
in her eyes, that with her was a sign of mingled embarrassment
and defiance.</p>

<p>Teresa’s heart began to beat a little faster; who
would Concha say she, Teresa, thought herself like?
And who would <i>she</i> say Concha thought herself like?
It would perhaps be a relief to them both to say, for once,
things that were definitely spiteful—a relief from this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
continual X-raying of each other’s thoughts, and never
a word said.</p>

<p>“Who does Guy think himself like? Some one very
wicked and beautiful—don’t you, Guy?” said Rory.</p>

<p>“Dorian Gray!” said Arnold, looking up from his
book with a meaning grin.</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, I’m sure it’s some very literary character,”
said Concha.</p>

<p>“Shelley?” suggested Teresa; but she gave the little
smile that always seemed scornful to Guy.</p>

<p>“Percy Bysshe ... is she right, Guy?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Guy sulkily.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare—Tennyson—Burns? Who, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Keats if you like—when he was in love with
Fanny Brawne,” cried Guy furiously, and, seizing the
book that lay nearest to him, he began to read it.</p>

<p>“I say, this <i>is</i> a lovely game—almost as good as
cock-fighting!” said Rory: “What about Mr. Lane?
I wonder who <i>you</i> think you are like, sir.”</p>

<p>Tactful young man, so anxious to make his host feel
at home!</p>

<p>Dick, who had been dreading this moment, looked
sheepish. It seemed to him that the forehead of every
one in the room slid sideways like a secret panel revealing
a wall upon which in large and straggling characters
were chalked up the words: <span class="allsmcap">DON JUAN</span>. And Teresa
was saying to herself: “Would it be vulgar ...
should I dare to say Lydia Bennett? And who will she
say? Hedda Gabler?”</p>

<p>She had forgotten what the game really was and had
come to think it consisted of telling the victim the
character that you <i>yourself</i> thought they resembled.</p>

<p>“Who does Mr. Lane think he’s like?” repeated
Rory.</p>

<p>“Drake, I should think,” said Guy, who never sulked
for long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>Dick felt unutterably relieved.</p>

<p>“Is that right, sir?”</p>

<p>“That will do—Drake if you like,” said Dick, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“A Drake somewhat ... er ... cramped in his
legitimate activities through having ... er ...
married an ... er ... <span class="allsmcap">SPANISH LADY</span>,” said Harry.</p>

<p>What the devil did he mean exactly by that? Surely
the Doña hadn’t been blabbing to him—Harry of all
people! But she was capable of anything.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, the Doña would see to it he didn’t singe the
King of Spain’s beard twice,” laughed Concha.</p>

<p>Oh yes, of course, <i>that</i> was it! He laughed aloud with
relief.</p>

<p>And then followed a discussion, which kept them busy
till luncheon, as to whether it could be proved by
Mendelism that the frequent singeing of Philip II.’s beard
was the cause of his successors having only an imperial.</p>

<p>So here was another proof of the fundamental undramaticness
of life as lived under civilised conditions—for
ever shying away from an emotional crisis. As usual,
the incident had been completely without point; and
on and on went the frivolous process of a piece of thistle-down
blown by a summer breeze hither, thither, nowhere,
everywhere.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Before the party broke up there was a little dance
at Plasencia. It was to be early and informal so as
not to exclude “flappers”; for, as is apt to be the way
with physically selfish men, Arnold found grown-up
young ladies too exacting to enjoy their society and
preferred teasing “flappers.” Fair play to him, he
never flirted with them; but he certainly liked them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>So the drawing-room was cleared of furniture, a
scratch meal of sandwiches substituted for dinner, and
by eight o’clock they were fox-trotting to the music of a
hired pianist and fiddler.</p>

<p>The bare drawing-room, robbed of all the accumulated
accessories of everyday life, was the symbol of
what was happening in the souls of the dancers—Dionysus
had come to Thebes, and, at the touch of his
thyrsus, the city had gone mad, had wound itself round
with vine tendrils, was flowing with milk and honey;
where were now the temples, where the market-place?</p>

<p>Teresa, steered backwards and forwards by Bob
Norton, felt a sudden distaste for mediæval books—read
always with an object; a sudden distaste, too, for that
object itself, which was riding her like a hag. Why not
yield to life, become part of it, instead of ever standing
outside of it, trying to snatch with one’s hands fragments
of it, as it went rushing by?</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That was good sense; that was peace. But away
from Plasencia ... yes, one must get away from
Plasencia.</p>

<p>For once, they were all beset by the same desire—to
slip off silently one night, leaving no trace.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I really get that yacht and slip off
with Hugh ... to Japan, say ... and no one know?
It’s a free country and I’ve got the money—there’s
nothing to prevent me doing what I want. To sail
right away from Anna ... and ... and ... <i>every
one</i>,” thought Dick, as, rather laboriously, he gambolled
round with the young wife of a rich stockbroker who
had a “cottage” near Plasencia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>As to Concha—she had sloughed her own past and
present and got into Rory’s—she seemed to <i>be</i> Rory:
lying in his study at Harrow after cricket sipping a
water-ice, which his fag had just brought him from the
tuck-shop ... “hoch!” and a tiny slipper shoots up
into the air—“the beautiful Miss Brabazons,” the
belles of the Northern Meeting!... “H.M. the King
and the Prince of Wales motored over from Balmoral
for the—Highland games. There were also present
...” flags flying, bands playing ... hunting before
the War—zizz! Up one goes—over gates, over hedges
... no gates, no hedges, no twelve-barred gates of
night and day, no seven-barred gates of weeks, just
galloping for ever over the boundless prairie of eternity—far
far away from Plasencia and them all.</p>

<p>Only the dowagers, watching the dancers from a little
conservatory off the drawing-room, had their roots deep
in time and space—a row of huge stone Buddhas set up
against a background of orchids and bougainvillea and
parroquet-streaked jungle, which were their teeming
memories of the past; but set up immovably, and they
would see to it that no one should escape.</p>

<p>“There!” said Rory, gently pushing Concha into a
chair, “where’s your cloak?”</p>

<p>“Don’t want one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’d better. Which is your room? Let me
go and fetch you one.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I don’t <i>want</i> one!”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, I meant to ask you, why did you
walk on ahead with Arnold this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Did I?”</p>

<p>“Of course you did. I had to walk with your sister—she
scared me to death.”</p>

<p>Then there was a pause.</p>

<p>“Concha!”</p>

<p>“Hallo!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>He gave a little laugh, took her in his arms, and kissed
her several times on the mouth.</p>

<p>“You didn’t kiss me back.”</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you know how to!”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> I?”</p>

<p>He kissed her again.</p>

<p>“What a funny mouth you’ve got—it’s soft like a
baby’s.”</p>

<p>“You’d better be careful—some one might come
along, you know, at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Would they be angry?... You <i>are</i> a baby!”</p>

<p>“Rory! The music’s stopping.”</p>

<p>Rory began talking in a loud voice: “Well, as I was
saying, Chislehurst golf is no good to me at all. I like
a course where you have plenty of room to open your
shoulders.”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a fool!” laughed Concha.</p>

<p>The next dance was a waltz.</p>

<p>“The <i>Blue Danube</i>! I’m <i>so</i> glad the waltz is coming
into fashion again,” said Mrs. Moore, tapping her black-satin-slippered
foot in time to the tune, and watching
her sixteen-year old daughter Lettice whirl round with
Arnold.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doña, “I’m fed up with rag-time.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Lane, these slangy expressions sound
so deliciously quaint when you use them—don’t they,
Lady Norton? And that reminds me, I’ve had such a
<i>killing</i> letter from Eben....”</p>

<p>But no one listened, and soon she too was silent; for,
at the strains of the <i>Blue Danube</i>, myriads of gold and
blue butterflies had swarmed out of the jungle and
settled on the Buddhas. They still stared in front of
them impassively, they were still firm as rocks; but they
were covered with butterflies.</p>

<p>“Waltzes are milestones of sentimentality,” said Guy
shrilly to Teresa, as they made their way onto the
loggia to sit out the remainder of the dance, “milestones
of sentimentality, because a lady can be dated
by the fact of whether it’s the <i>Blue Danube</i>, or the
<i>Sourire d’Avril</i>, or the <i>Merry Widow</i>, that glazes her eye
and parts her lips—taking her back to that charming
period when the heels of Mallarmé’s <i>débutantes</i> go tap,
tap, tap, when in a deliciously artificial atmosphere sex
expands and, like some cunning hunted insect, makes
itself look like a flower; I haven’t yet read <i>A l’Ombre
des Jeunes Filles en Fleur</i>, but I’m sure it’s an exquisite
description of that period—débutantes, and waltzes,
and camouflaged sex. Its very title is like the name of
a French waltz—or scent.”</p>

<p>Teresa smiled vaguely.... Why had she scorned
that period, barricading herself against it with books,
and Bach and ... myths? When she was old and
heard the strains of ... yes, the <i>Chocolate Soldier</i> ought
to be her milestone ... well, when she hears the
<i>Chocolate Soldier</i>, if her eyes glaze and her lips part
it will be out of mere bravado.</p>

<p>But something was happening ... what was it Guy
was saying?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“I never think of anything else but you ... you’re
the only person whose mind I admire ... even if you
don’t realise it you <i>must</i> see that you ought to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Guy, what do you want? What is it all about?”
she gasped helplessly.</p>

<p>“Well then, could you? You see, it seems to me so
obvious and....”</p>

<p>“Marry you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She saw herself established in St. James’s Street
polishing his brasses, rub, rub, rub; polishing his verses
perhaps too ... oh no, he didn’t like verses to be
polished—roughening them, then, with emery-paper ...
oh no, that polished too ... what was it, then, that
roughened?</p>

<p>She began to giggle ... oh Lord, <i>that</i> had done it!
Now he was furious—and with reason.</p>

<p>“... Your arrogance ... simply unbearable....
I don’t know <i>what</i> you think ... oh it’s damnable!”
and he began to sob.</p>

<p>She took his hand and stroked it, murmuring:
“Hush! old Guy ... I wasn’t laughing at you, it
was just one of those sudden silly thoughts that have
nothing to do with anything. Nothing seems real
to-night. I’m really very very grateful.”</p>

<p>“Will you then?” and his face brightened.</p>

<p>“No, no, Guy—I <i>can’t</i>. It would be so ... so ...
meaningless.”</p>

<p>Then fresh sobs, and like a passionate, proud child he
tore away his hands, and plunged into the dark garden.
What could she do? She could only leave him to get
over it.</p>

<p>Life was never still; though, like the earth, one did
not feel it move ... one’s human relations were
ever shifting, silently, like those of the constellations.
Suddenly one night one looks up at the sky and realises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
that Orion has reappeared and that the Great Bear is
now standing on the tip of his tail, and one gasps at
the vast spaces that have been silently traversed; and
it was with the same sensation of awe that she looked
back on the past year and realised the silent changes in
the inter-relations of her little group: her parents’
relations, her own and Concha’s, her own and Guy’s.</p>

<p>A low voice came from the morning-room; it was
the Doña’s: “Whatever Pepa’s opinions or wishes may
have been during the latter part of her life, they are
the same as mine now.”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul! You evidently ... er ... er
have sources of ... er ... <span class="smcap">information</span> closed to
the rest of us—I really cannot ... er ... <span class="smcap">cope</span> with
such statements” and Harry came out on to the loggia,
evidently irritated beyond endurance. He was followed
by the Doña; but when she saw Teresa and realised
that the opportunity for a <i>tête-à-tête</i> was over, having told
her to get a wrap, she went in again.</p>

<p>Harry walked up and down for a few seconds, in
silence, and then ejaculated ironically: “Remarkable
woman, your mother!” “Very!” said Teresa coldly;
she did not choose to discuss her with Harry.</p>

<p>“Of course, in the light of ... er ... modern
psychology it’s as clear as a pike-staff,” he went on, as
usual not reacting to the emotional atmosphere, “she
... er ... doesn’t ... er ... <span class="smcap">know</span> it, of course,
but she’s putting up this Catholicism as a barrier to
your marriages—every mother is jealous of her
daughters.”</p>

<p>Oh, these scientific people! Always right, and, yet,
at the same time, always absurdly wrong! For the
real sages, the people who <i>live</i> life, these ugly little
treasures found by the excavators miles and miles and
miles down into the human soul, are of absolutely no
value ... horrid little flints that have long since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
evolved into beautiful bronze axes ... it was only
scientists that cared about that sort of thing. For all
practical purposes it was an absolute libel on the Doña—but,
<i>dramatically</i>, it might be of value; for dramatic
values have nothing to do with truth.</p>

<p>“Our dance, I think, Miss Lane. I couldn’t find
you anywhere”; it was Rory’s voice.</p>

<p>He led her into the drawing-room, and they began
to move up and down, round and round, among the
other solemn and concentrated couples, all engaged in
too serious an exercise to indulge in any conversation
beyond an occasional: “Sorry!” “Oh, <i>sorry</i>!”</p>

<p>When they passed Concha, she and Rory smiled at
each other, and he said: “Telegrams: <i>Oysters</i>.”</p>

<p>That meant: “We are both rather hungry, but never
mind, it won’t be long now till supper—Hurray!”</p>

<p>How humiliating it was to be so familiar with their
jargon!</p>

<p>She looked at him; his eyes were stern, and fixed on
some invisible point beyond her shoulder, his lips were
slightly parted. She was no more to him than the
compass with which Newton in Blake’s picture draws
geometrical figures on the sand.</p>

<p>Then the music stopped.</p>

<p>“Shall we sit here?”</p>

<p>He had become human again.</p>

<p>“It <i>has</i> been a lovely dance—I do think it’s so
awfully good of you all to have me down for Christmas.”</p>

<p>How many times exactly had she heard that during
the last week? Once before to herself, twice to the
Doña, once to her father, once to Jollypot.</p>

<p>“Oh, we liked having you. We generally have lots
of people for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Well, one couldn’t have a more Christmassy house.
It always seems to me like the house one suddenly comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
upon in a wood in a fairy story. One expects the door
to be opened by a badger in livery.”</p>

<p>Again that bastard Fancy! The same sort of thing
had occurred to her herself—<i>when</i> she was a child; but
the imagination of a man ought to be different from the
fancy of a child.</p>

<p>“It’s the sort of house one can imagine a Barrie play
happening in, don’t you think? Did you see <i>Dear
Brutus</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I did.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t like the girl much—what was her name?
Margaret, wasn’t it? I’m sure her papa starved her—I
longed to take her and give her a good square meal.”
Pause.</p>

<p>She wondered what it would feel like to be the sort
of young woman who could interest and allure him.
And what were the qualities needed? It could not be
brains, for she had plenty of brains; nor looks, for she
was good-looking. But nothing about her stirred him;
she knew it.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s an extraordinary hard life, an actress’s,”
he went on, “it’s a wonder that they keep their looks
as they do. It’s a shame! Women seem handicapped
all along the line,” and he looked at her expectantly, as
if sure of her approval at last, “It can’t be much fun
being a woman, unless one were a very beautiful one ...
or a very clever one, of course,” he added hastily.</p>

<p>Well, the cat was out of the bag: she was plain as
well as undesirable.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Dionysus and his rout vanished from
Thebes; temples and market-place sprang up again,
and she remembered joyfully that a fresh packet of
books ought to arrive to-morrow from the London
Library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Most of the guests not staying in the house had left
by midnight; but after that, when the party had
dwindled down to four or five couples, the pianist and
fiddler, mellowed by champagne and oysters, were
persuaded to give first one “extra,” then another, then
another.</p>

<p>The pianist, a very anæmic-looking young woman,
with a touching absence of class-jealousy, was loath to
disappoint them, and, as far as she was concerned, they
might have gone on having extras till broad daylight;
but the fiddler “turned stunt.”</p>

<p>“I’m a family man” he protested good-humouredly,
but firmly (“You’ll have to wait till to-morrow night
for <i>that</i>, old bean!” Rory whispered to Arnold, “your
wife wouldn’t like it at two o’clock in the morning”),
“But I don’t mind ending up with <i>John Peel</i>, as it’s
Christmas time,” whereupon, with a wink to the pianist,
he struck up with that most poetical of tunes, and, the
men of the party bellowing the words, they all broke
into a boisterous gallop.</p>

<p>Rory went up to the Doña: “You <i>must</i> dance this
with me, please!”</p>

<p>She yielded with a smile; but her eye caught Arnold’s,
and they both remembered that it had been Pepa who
used always to play <i>John Peel</i> at the end of their dances.</p>

<p>The tune ended with what means to be a flourish,
but really is a wail, and they stood still, laughing
and breathless—a little haggard, a little dishevelled.</p>

<p>“Where’s Guy?” said some one.</p>

<p>“He went up to bed; he had a headache,” said
Arnold, glaring fiercely at Teresa.</p>

<p>Out in the view, from behind the two-ply curtains of
silk and of night, a cock crew, and then another; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
what they said was just <i>John Peel</i> over again—that
ghosts wander in dewy English glades, and that the
Past is dead, dead, dead.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Concha came into Teresa’s room to have her gown
unfastened: “You looked heavenly,” she said, “I love
you in mauve.”</p>

<p>Teresa tugged at the hooks in silence; and then said:
“Is it impossible to teach Parker to unsqueeze hooks
when they come back from Pullar’s?”</p>

<p>“Quite. I nearly died with the effort of getting
them to fasten.”</p>

<p>Then outside there was a familiar muffled step, and a
knock. In the mirror Teresa saw a look of annoyance
pass over Concha’s face.</p>

<p>In came the Doña, in a white dressing-gown, her face
illuminated by the flame of her candle, and looking not
unlike one of Zurburán’s Carthusian monks.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said.</p>

<p>“Well darling,” answered Concha, with exaggerated
nonchalance, adding to Teresa, “<i>won’t</i> they undo?”</p>

<p>The Doña put down her candle, and seated herself
heavily on the bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, damn them! Won’t they undo? Haven’t
you any scissors?”</p>

<p>“That young Dundas seemed to enjoy himself,” said
the Doña.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Then the hooks yielded at last to the leverage of the
nail-scissors, and Concha kissed the Doña and Teresa
and went back to her own room.</p>

<p>The Doña sat on.</p>

<p>“Do you think he is attracted by Concha?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“That young Dundas.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know ... do you want him to be?”</p>

<p>“Do I want him to be? What has that to do with
it? I want to know if he <i>is</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean does he want to marry her?”</p>

<p>“Marry her! Englishmen never think of marriage
... they just what you call ‘rag round’; they can’t
even fall in love.”</p>

<p>Teresa scrutinised her for a few seconds, and then
she said: “I believe you are furious with every man
who doesn’t fall in love with one of your daughters;”
and she suddenly remembered a remark of Concha’s
made in a moment of intense irritation: “The Doña
ought to keep a brothel—then she would be really
happy.”</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>That year winter was so mild as to be almost indistinguishable
from spring. Imperceptibly, the sparse
patches of snow, the hyacinthine patches of blue light
lying in hollows of the hills, in wrinkles of the land, turned
into small waxen leafless flowers, watching, waiting, in
the grass.</p>

<p>By the beginning of February the song of the birds
had begun; a symbol that to most hearts is almost
Chinese, the symbol and its idea being so indistinguishable
that it seems that it is Hope herself who is perched
out there on the top of the trees, singing.</p>

<p>One day one would suddenly realise that the mirabelle
and purple prunus were actually out; but blossom is
such a chilly thing, and it arrives so quietly, that
it seemed to make no difference in that leafless
world.</p>

<p>Then would come a day when the air was exquisitely
soft and the sky very blue; and between the sky and
earth there would seem to be a silent breathless conspiracy.
Not a bud, only silence; but one knew that
something would soon happen. But the next morning,
there would be an east wind—skinning the bloom
off the view, turning the sky to lead, and making the
mirabelle and prunus look, in their leaflessness, so bleak
that they might have been the flower (in its sense
of <i>essence, embodiment of</i>), of the stern iron qualities of
January. The singing of the birds, too, became a cold,
cold sound, as if the east wind was, like the ether, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
medium through which we hear as well as see. But
such days were rare.</p>

<p>Dick loved early spring. When the children were
little they used to have “treasure-hunts” at their
Christmas parties. They would patter through drawing-room,
dining-room, hall, billiard-room, finding, say,
an india-rubber duck in the crown of a hat, or a
bag of sweets in a pocket of the billiard-table; and
Dick’s walks through the grounds in these early spring
days were like these “treasure-hunts”; for he would
suddenly come upon a patch of violets under a wall,
or track down a sudden waft of perfume to a leafless
bush starred with the small white blossoms of winter-sweet,
or—greatest prize of all—stand with throbbing
heart by the hedges of yew, gazing into a nest with
four white eggs, while he whispered: “Look
Anna!”</p>

<p>For this was the first year that he had gone on these
hunts alone.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he was very tired of his <i>liaison</i>.
The lady was expensive, and her conversation was
insipid. Also ... <i>perhaps</i> ... his blood was not
<i>quite</i> as hot as it had once been.</p>

<p>“Buck up, old bean! What’s the <i>matter</i> with you?”
... <i>The fires within are waning</i> ... where had he
heard that expression? Oh yes, it was what Jollypot
had said about that old Hun conductor, Richter, when,
years ago, they had taken her to Covent Garden to
hear <i>Tristan</i>—how they had laughed! It was such a
ridiculous expression to use about such a stolid old Hun
and, besides, it happened to be quite untrue, Pepa and
Teresa had said.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you to-night, you juggins?”
<i>The fires within are waning</i> ... it was all very well
to laugh, but really it was rather a beautiful expression....
Good Lord! It wasn’t so many years before he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
would be reaching his grand climacteric.... Peter
Trevers died then, so did Jim Lane.</p>

<p class="tb">One morning he noticed the Doña standing stock-still
in the middle of the lawn, staring at something through
her <i>lorgnette</i>. She was smiling. “What a beautiful
mouth she has!” he thought, as he drew nearer.</p>

<p>Softly he came up and stood beside her, and discovered
that what she was watching was a thrush that
was engaged, by means of a series of sharp rhythmic
pecks, in hauling out of the ground the fat white coils
of an enormous worm.</p>

<p>It reminded him of a Russian song that his lady
had on her gramophone, the <i>Volga Boat Song</i>—the
haulers on the Volga sang it as they hauled in the ropes....
<i>I-i-sh-tscho-rass</i> he began to hum; she looked up
quickly: “You remember that?”</p>

<p>“What?” he asked nervously. In answer, she sang
to the same tune: <i>Ma-ri-nee-ro</i>, and then said: “The
sailors used to sing it at Cadiz, that autumn we spent
there ... when the children were little.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes, so they did!” he answered with a
self-deprecatory laugh.</p>

<p>The thrush had now succeeded in hauling up almost
the whole length of the worm; and it lay on the ground
really very like the coils of a miniature rope. Then
suddenly he lost the rhythm, changed his method to a
series of little jerky, impatient, ineffectual desultory
taps, pausing between each to look round with a bright
<i>distrait</i> eye; and, finally, when a few more taps would
have finished the job, off he hopped, as if he could bear
it no longer.</p>

<p>“Silly fellow!” said the Doña.</p>

<p>Dick was racking his brain in the hopes of finding
some link between thrushes and Pepa.... “Pepa
was very fond of thrushes” ... but was she?...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
“Pepa with the garden hose was rather like that thrush
with the worm” ... and wasn’t there an infant
malady called “thrush” ... had Pepa ever had it?
no, no, it wouldn’t do; later on an apter occasion would
arise for some tender little reconciliatory reminiscence.</p>

<p>“You know, I had little Anna and Jasper baptised
into the Catholic Church at Christmas,” said the Doña
suddenly, and, as it seemed to Dick, quite irrelevantly;
but her voice was unmistakably friendly.</p>

<p>“By Jove ... did you really?”</p>

<p>“I did. I arranged it with Father Dawson. The
children enjoyed keeping it a secret from Harry.”</p>

<p>Dick chuckled; the Doña smiled.</p>

<p>“Next year little Anna will make her first Communion.”</p>

<p>“Does she want to?” Dick had never noticed in his
grand-daughter the slightest leanings to religion.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There are compensations,” and
again the Doña smiled.</p>

<p>“What? a new Girl-Guide kit?”</p>

<p>“No; the complete works of Scott.”</p>

<p>“My dear Anna—you ought to have been the General
of the Jesuits!”</p>

<p>The Doña looked flattered.</p>

<p>“Well, Dick,” she went on in a brisk, but still friendly
voice, “we really must decide soon—<i>are</i> we going to
have pillar-roses or clematis at the back of the borders?
Rudge says....”</p>

<p>They spent a happy, amicable morning together; and
at luncheon their daughters were conscious that the
tension between them had considerably relaxed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>One sunny evening, walking in his pleasance, and
weaving out of memories chaplets for a dear head, as, in
the dead years, he had woven them out of those roses,
white and damask, the Knight of La Tour-Landry
resolved to compile, from the “matter of England,
France and Rome,” a book for the guidance of his
motherless daughters.</p>

<p>In that book Teresa read the following <i>exemplum</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is contained in the story of Constantinople, there
was an Emperor had two daughters, and the youngest
had good conditions, for she loved well God, and prayed
him, at all times that she awaked, for the dead. And
as she and her sister lay a-bed, her sister awoke and
heard her at her prayers, and scorned and mocked her,
and said, ‘hold your peace, for I may not sleep for
you.’ And so it happened that youth constrained them
both to love two brethren, that were knights, and were
goodly men. And so the sisters told their council each
to other. And at the last they gave the Knights tryst
that they should come to lie by them by night privily
at certain hour. And that one came to the youngest
sister, but him thought he saw a thousand dead bodies
about her in sheets; and he was so sore afraid and afeard,
that he ran away as he had been out of himself, and
caught the fevers and great sickness through the fear
that he had, and laid him in his bed, and might not stir
for sickness. But that other Knight came into that
other sister without letting, and begat her with child.
And when her father wist she was with child, he made
cast her into the river, and drench her and her child,
and he made to scorch the Knight quick. Thus, for
that delight, they were both dead; but that other sister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
was saved. And I shall tell you on the morrow it was
in all the house, how that one Knight was sick in his
bed; and the youngest sister went to see him and asked
him whereof he was sick. ‘As I went to have entered
between the curtains of your bed, I saw so great number
of dead men, that I was nigh mad for fear, and yet I
am afeard and afraid of the sight.’ And when she heard
that, she thanked God humbly that had kept her from
shame and destruction.... And therefore, daughters,
bethink you on this example when ye wake, and sleep
not till ye have prayed for the dead, as did the youngest
daughter.”</p>

</div>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Towards the end of February Teresa heard excited
voices coming from the Doña’s morning-room. She
went in and found the Doña sitting on the sofa with a
white face and blazing eyes, her father nervously shifting
the ornaments on the chimneypiece, and Concha
standing in the middle of the room and looking as
obstinate as Caroline the donkey.</p>

<p>“Teresa!” the Doña said in a very quiet voice,
“Concha tells us she is engaged to Captain Dundas.”</p>

<p>But of course!... had not Parker said that there
was “the marriage likeness” between them—“both
with such lovely blue eyes?”</p>

<p>“And he has written to your father—we have just
received this letter,” and the Doña handed it to her:
“From the letter and from her we learn that Captain
Dundas has perverted her. She is going to become a
Protestant.”</p>

<p>There was a pause; Concha’s face did not move a
muscle.</p>

<p>“The reason why she is going to do this is that
Captain Dundas would be disinherited by his uncle if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
he married a Catholic. What do you think of this
conduct, Teresa?”</p>

<p>Concha looked at her defiantly.</p>

<p>“I don’t ... I ... if Concha doesn’t believe in
it all, I don’t see why she should sacrifice her happiness
to something she doesn’t believe in,” she found herself
saying.</p>

<p>Concha’s face relaxed for a second, and she flashed
her a look of gratitude.</p>

<p>“Teresa!” cried the Doña, and her voice was inexpressibly
reproachful.</p>

<p>Dick turned round from the chimneypiece: “Teresa’s
quite right,” he said; “upon my soul, it would be madness,
as she says, to sacrifice one’s happiness for ...
for that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Dick!”</p>

<p>And he turned from the cold severity of the
Doña’s voice and eye to a re-examination of the
ornaments.</p>

<p>As to Teresa, though his words had been but an echo
and corroboration of her own, she was unreasonable
enough to be shocked by them; coming, as they did,
from a descendant of the men who had witnessed the
magnificent gesture with which Ridley and Latimer had
lit a candle in England.</p>

<p>“Well, Teresa, as you think the same as Concha ...
I don’t know what I have done.... I seem to have
failed very much as a mother. It must be my own
fault,” and she laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>Concha’s face softened: “Doña!” she said appealingly.</p>

<p>“Concha! Are you really going to do this terrible
thing?”</p>

<p>“I must ... it’s what Teresa said ... I mean ...
it would be so mad not to!”</p>

<p>“I see—it would be mad not to sell Jesus for thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
pieces of silver. Well, in that case, there is nothing
more to be said ... and you have your father and
sister as supporters,” and again she laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>Concha’s face again hardened; and, with a shrug,
she left the room.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few seconds, and Teresa
glanced mechanically at the letter she held in her hand:
“... won’t think it frightful cheek ... go rather
gently while I’m at the Staff College ... my uncle ...
Drumsheugh ... allowance ... will try so hard to
make Concha happy ... my uncle ... Drumsheugh
... hope Mrs. Lane won’t mind frightfully ... the
Scottish Episcopal Church ... very high, it doesn’t
acknowledge the Pope, that’s the only difference.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the Doña began to sob convulsively: “She
... is ... my child, my baby! Oh, none of you
understand ... none of you <i>understand</i>! It’s my
fault ... I have sinned ... I ought never to have
married a Protestant. My Pepa ... my poor Pepa
... she knows <i>now</i> ... she would stop it if she could.
Oh, <i>what</i> have I done?”</p>

<p>Teresa kneeled down beside her, and took one of her
cold hands in hers; she herself was cold and trembling—she
had only once before, at Pepa’s death, seen her
mother break down.</p>

<p>Dick came to her other side, and gently stroked her
hair: “My dear, you’ve nothing to blame yourself for,”
he said, “and there are really lots of good Protestants,
you know. And I’ve met some very broad-minded
Roman Catholics, too, who took a ... a ... sensible
view of it all. These Spanish priests are apt....”</p>

<p>“Spanish priests!” she cried, sitting up in her
chair and turning blazing eyes upon him, “what do
<i>you</i> know of Spanish priests? You, an elderly Don
Juan Tenorio!”</p>

<p>Dick flushed: “Well, I <i>have</i> heard you know ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
those priests of yours aren’t all so mighty immaculate,”
he said sullenly.</p>

<p>“Dick! How—<i>dare</i>—you?” and having first frozen
him with her stare, she got up and left the room.</p>

<p>Dick turned to Teresa: “For heaven’s sake,” he said,
“do make your mother see that Protestants are
Christians too, that they aren’t all blackguards.”</p>

<p>“It would be no good—that’s really got nothing to
do with it,” said Teresa wearily.</p>

<p>“Nothing to do with it? Oh, well—you’re all too
deep for <i>me</i>. Anyhow, it’s all a most awful storm in a
teacup, and the thing that really makes her so angry
is that she knows perfectly well she can do nothing to
prevent it. Well, do go up to her now.... <i>I</i> daren’t
show my face within a mile ... get her some <i>eau-de-Cologne</i>
or something. ’Snice! ’Snice, old man! Come
along then, and look at the crocuses,” and, followed by
’Snice, he went through the French window into the
garden.</p>

<p>Yes; her father had been partly right—a very bitter
element in it all was that the passionate dominant Doña
could do nothing to prevent the creatures of her body
from managing their lives in their own way. What help
was it that behind her stood the convictions of the
multitudinous dead, the “bishops, priests, deacons,
sub-deacons, acolytes, exorcists, lectors, porters, confessors,
virgins, widows, and all the holy people of God?”
She and they were powerless to arrest the incoming tide
of life; she had identified herself with the dead—with
what was old, crazy, and impotent, and, therefore, she
was pre-doomed to failure.</p>

<p>Teresa had a sudden vision of the sinful couch (according
to the Doña’s views) of Concha and Rory, infested
by the dead: “I say, Concha, what a frightful bore!
They ought to have given us a mosquito-net.” “Oh
Lord! Well, never mind—I’m simply <i>dropping</i> with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
sleep.” And so to bed, comfortably mattressed by the
shrouds of the “holy people of God.”</p>

<p>She went up and tried the Doña’s door, but found it
locked. She felt that she ought next to go to Concha,
upon whom, she told herself, all this was very hard—that
she, who had merely set out upon the flowery path that
had been made by the feet of myriads and myriads of
other sane and happy people since the world began,
should have her joy dimmed, her laughter arrested, by
ghosts and other peoples’ delusions. But, though she
told herself this, she could not feel any real pity; her
heart was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>However, she went to Concha’s room, and found her
sitting at her desk writing a letter—probably a long
angry one to that other suffering sage, Elfrida Penn.</p>

<p>“Poor old Concha!” she said, “I’m sorry it should
be like this for you.”</p>

<p>Concha—puffed up with the sense of being a symbol
of a whole generation—scowled angrily: “Oh, it’s all
too fantastic! Thank the Lord I’ll soon be out of all
this!”</p>

<p>At times there was something both dour and ungracious
about Concha—a complete identification of
herself with the unbecoming rôles she chose to act.</p>

<p>Teresa found herself wondering if, after all, she herself
had not more justification with regard to her than
recently she had come to fear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>By the middle of March, Concha’s engagement had
become an accepted fact: Dick and Rory’s uncle,
Colonel Dundas of Drumsheugh, had exchanged letters;
the marriage was fixed for the beginning of July;
wedding presents had already begun to drift in.</p>

<p>Even the Doña began to be hypnotised by the
inevitable, and to find a little balm in the joys of the
trousseau.</p>

<p>In Parker’s sewing-room little scenes like this would
take place: “No, Concha, I <i>won’t</i> allow you to have
them so low. You might as well be stark naked.”</p>

<p>Then Parker would giggle, and Concha, after a good-natured
“Good Lord!” would say, “I tell you, Doña,
they’re always <i>worn</i> like that now.”</p>

<p>“That makes <i>no</i> difference to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>darling</i>! I believe you’d like me to borrow one
of Jollypot’s as a pattern—they’re flannel and up to her
ears, and the sleeves reach down to her nails.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Concha!” Parker would titter, both
shocked and amused; and the Doña, with a snort, would
exclaim, “That poor Jollypot! To think of her sleeping
in flannel! But there are many degrees between the
nightgowns of Jollypot and those of a <i>demi-mondaine</i>,
and you remember what Father Vaughan ...” and
then she would suddenly realise that the views on
<i>lingerie</i> of the Roman hierarchy no longer carried any
weight with Concha, and in a chilly voice she would
say, “Well, you and Parker had better settle it in your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
own way; it has nothing to do with me ... <i>now</i>,”
and would sweep out of the room with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>One evening Dick, who had been in London for the
day, said at dinner, “By the way I met Munroe in the
city. He caught flu in that beastly cold seminary, and
it turned into pneumonia. He looked very bad, poor
chap. He’s on sick leave at present, and I was wondering
...” and he looked timidly at the Doña: (Since
his escapade he had become a very poor-spirited
creature.) “I was wondering, Anna ... if you don’t
mind, of course, if we might ask him down for a few
days.”</p>

<p>“Poor young man! Certainly,” said the Doña, with
unusual warmth; for, as a rule, she deplored her
husband’s unbridled hospitality.</p>

<p>“I wonder ... a very odd thing ... he was getting
on extraordinarily well in business and everything....
He was asking about you, Concha, and your engagement.
Yon saw a good deal of him, didn’t you? Have you been
breaking his heart and turning him monk?”</p>

<p>Concha laughed; gratified, evidently, by the suggestion.
But the Doña said coldly, “Concha was probably
merely one of the many tests to which he was putting
his vocation—and, evidently, not a very sweet one....
What are you all laughing at? Oh, I see! I’ve used
the wrong word—<i>Acid</i> test, if you like it better.”</p>

<p>But, though she laughed, Concha’s sensitive vanity
flooded her cheeks.</p>

<p>That same night Dick wrote off to David Munroe telling
him to come down at once and spend his convalescence
at Plasencia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>David Munroe arrived two days later. The Doña
welcomed him very warmly, and then, having got him
some illustrated papers, left him alone in the drawing-room,
and hurried back to the sewing-room, where she
was busy with Parker over the trousseau.</p>

<p>Teresa, coming in to look for a book about a quarter
of an hour later, was surprised to find him already
arrived, as she had not heard the car. In a flash she
took in the badly cut semi-clerical black suit hanging
on his strong well-knit body, and noticed how hollow-eyed
and pale he had become.</p>

<p>She greeted him kindly, coolly; slightly embarrassed
by the intentness of his gaze.</p>

<p>“We are so glad you were able to come. It’s so
horrible to be ill in an institution. But you ought to
get well soon now, the weather’s so heavenly, and you’ll
soon be able to lie out in the garden,” she said, and began
to look for her book.</p>

<p>He watched her in silence for a few seconds, and then
said, “Miss Lane, when I was here last, I gave you to
understand that I was the heir to Munroe of Auchenballoch....
I’ll admit it was said as a sort of a joke
when I was angry, but it was a lie for all that. I come
of quite plain people.”</p>

<p>Clearly, he was “making his soul” against ordination.
She tried to feel irritated, and say in a cold and slightly
surprised voice, “Really? I’m afraid I don’t remember
... er ...” but what she actually said was: “It
doesn’t matter a bit; it was obviously, as you say, just
a joke ... at least ... er ... well, at any rate,
I haven’t the slightest idea what <i>our</i> great-grandfather
was—quite likely a fishmonger; at any rate, I’m sure
he was far from aristocratic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>David gave a sort of grunt and began restlessly to pace
up and down; this fidgeted Teresa: “Do sit down,
Mr. Munroe,” she said, “you must be so tired. I can’t
think where my sister is—she’ll come down soon, I
expect,” and added to herself, “I really don’t see
why I should have to entertain Concha’s discarded
suitors.”</p>

<p>He sank slowly into an arm-chair. “Miss Lane,” he
said, “is it true that your sister is leaving the Catholic
fold?”</p>

<p>“I believe so,” she answered; and there was a note
of dryness in her voice.</p>

<p>There was a pause; David leaning forward and staring
at the Persian rug at his feet with knitted brows, as if
it were a document in a strange and difficult script.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up and said; “Why is she doing
that?”</p>

<p>“That you must ask <i>her</i>,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p>“I heard ... that ... that it was because Captain
Dundas’s uncle wouldn’t leave him Drumsheugh, if he
married a Catholic, but ... that wouldn’t be true,
would it?”</p>

<p>“What? That Colonel Dundas has a prejudice
against Catholics?”</p>

<p>“No, that that’s the reason she’s leaving the Church?”</p>

<p>She gave a little shrug: “Well, I suppose Paris
makes up for a mass.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds he looked puzzled, and then said,
“Oh yes, that was Henry IV. of France—only the other
way round.... That was a curious case of Grace
working through queer channels—a man finding the
Church and salvation through worldliness and treachery
to his friends. But I shouldn’t wonder if what I was
saying wasn’t heresy—I’m not very learned in the
Fathers yet.”</p>

<p>He paused; and then, fixing her with his eyes, said—“Did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
it shock <i>you</i> very much—her being perverted for
such a reason?”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Munroe,” she said coldly, “my feelings
about the matter are nobody’s concern, I....”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said gruffly, and blushed to
the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>“Oh these touchy Scots!” she thought impatiently.</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence for some seconds, and
she decided the only way to “save his face” was to
ask <i>him</i> a personal question, and give him the chance of
snubbing her in his turn; so she said, “We had no idea
when you stayed with us last autumn that you were
thinking of being ordained ... but perhaps you
weren’t thinking of it then?”</p>

<p>He did not answer at once, but seemed to be meditating:
“It’s never quite a matter of <i>thinking</i>,” he said
finally, “it’s just a drifting ... drawn on and on by
the perfumes of the Church. What is it the Vulgate says
again? <i>In odore unguentorum tuorum curremus</i> ...”
he broke off, and then after a few seconds, as if summing
up, slightly humorously, the situation, he added ruminatively,
the monosyllable “úhu!” And the queer
Scots ejaculation seemed to give a friendly, homely turn
to his statement.</p>

<p>“You were lucky being born in the Church,” he went
on; “my father was an Established Church minister up
in Inverness-shire, and I was taught to look upon the
Church as the Scarlet Woman. I remember once at
the Laird’s I ... well, I came near to bringing up
my tea because Lady Stewart happened to say that
her cook was a Catholic. And sometimes still,” and
he lowered his voice and looked at her with half
frightened eyes, “sometimes still I feel a wee bit
sick at mass.”</p>

<p>It was indeed strange that he too should feel the
<i>ambivalence</i> of the Holy Mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” she said; “I never exactly
feel sick—but I know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” he cried eagerly, “and you brought up
in it too!”</p>

<p>He got up, took a few restless paces up and down the
room, and then stood still before a sketch in water-colours
of Seville Cathedral, staring at it with unseeing
eyes. Suddenly, he seemed to relax, and he returned
to his chair.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “when one comes to think of it, you
know, it would be hard to find a greater sin than ...
feeling like that at mass.” Then a slow smile crept over
his face: “I remember my father telling me that his
father met a wee lad somewhere in the Highlands, and
asked him what he’d had to his breakfast, and he said,
“brose,”—and then what he’d had to his dinner, and
he said “brose,” and then what he’d had to his tea,
and it was brose again; so my grandfather said, “D’you
not get tired of nothing but brose?” and the wee lad
turned on him, quite indignant, and said, “Wud ye hae
me weary o’ ma meat?” ... It’s not just exactly the
same, I’ll admit—but it was a fine spirit the wee lad
showed.”</p>

<p>A little wind blew in through one of the open windows,
very balmy, fresh from its initiation into the secret of
its clan,—a secret not unlike that of the Venetian
glass-blowers, and whispered from wind to wind
down the ages—the secret of blowing the earth into the
colours and shapes of violets and daffodils. It made the
summer cretonne curtains creak and the Hispano-Mauresque
plates knock against the wall on which they
were fastened and give out tiny ghostly chimes; as
did also the pendent balls on the Venetian glass. Teresa
suddenly thought of the late Pope listening to the
chimes of St. Mark’s on a gramophone. All at once
she became very conscious of the furniture—it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
whiff of that strange experience she had had in her
Chelsea lodgings. Far away in the view a cock crowed.
She suddenly wondered if the piano-tuner were coming
that morning.</p>

<p>“The Presbyterians, you know,” he was saying,
“they’re not like the Episcopalians; they feel things
more ... well, more concretely ... for instance, they
picture themselves taking their Sabbath walk some day
down the golden streets ... they seem to ... well,
it’s different.” He paused, and then went on, “My
people were very poor, you know; it was just a wee
parish and a very poor one, and it was just as much as
my mother could do to make both ends meet. But one
day she came into my father’s study—I remember, he
was giving me my Latin lesson—and in her hand she
held one of these savings boxes for deep-sea fishermen,
and she said, “Donald”—that was my father’s name—“Donald,
every cleric should go to the Holy Land;
there’s a hundred pound in here I’ve saved out of the
house-keeping money, so away with you as soon as you
can get off.” How she’d managed it goodness only
knows, and she’d never let <i>us</i> feel the pinch anywhere.
You’d not find an Episcopal minister’s wife doing that!”
and he looked at her defiantly.</p>

<p>“No; perhaps not ... that was very fine. Did
your father like the Holy Land when he got there?”</p>

<p>There was something at once pathetic and grotesque
in the sudden vision she had of the Presbyterian
pilgrim, with a baggy umbrella for staff, and a
voluminous and shabby portmanteau for script,
meticulously placing his elastic-sided boots in his
Master’s footprints.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he liked it—he said it was a fine mountainous
country with a rare light atmosphere—though Jerusalem
was not as ‘golden’ as he had been led to understand!
and he met some Russian pilgrims there, and he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
often talk of their wonderful child-like faith ... but
I think he thought it a pity, all the same, that Our Lord
wasn’t born in Scotland,” and he smiled.</p>

<p>Her fancy played for a few seconds round the life,
the mind, of that dead minister:</p>

<p>“... But to his lack-lustre eyes there appeared
within the pages of the ponderous, unwieldy, neglected
tomes, the sacred name of <span class="allsmcap">JEHOVAH</span> in Hebrew capitals:
pressed down by the weight of the style, worn to the
last fading thinness of the understanding, there were
glimpses, glimmering notions of the patriarchal wanderings,
with palm trees hovering in the horizon, and
processions of camels at the distance of three thousand
years; there was Moses with the Burning Bush, the
number of the Twelve Tribes, types, shadows, glosses
on the law and the prophets ... the great lapses of
time, the strange mutations of the globe were unfolded
with the voluminous leaf, as it turned over; and
though the soul might slumber with an hieroglyphic
veil of inscrutable mysteries drawn over it, yet it was
a slumber ill exchanged for all the sharpened realities
of sense, wit, fancy, or reason. My father’s life was
comparatively a dream; but it was a dream of infinity
and eternity, of death, the resurrection, and a
judgment to come!”</p>

<p>It was not that this passage word for word stalked
through her head; it was just a sudden whiff of memory
of this passage. And on its wings it wafted the perfume
of all the melancholy eloquence of Hazlitt—the smell,
the vision, of noble autumn woods between Salisbury
and Andover. If ever a man had not walked dry-shod
that man was Hazlitt; all his life he had waded up to
the waist in Time and Change and Birth and Death,
and they had been to him what he held green, blue,
red, and yellow to have been to Titian: “the pabulum
to his sense, the precious darlings of his eye,” which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
“sunk into his mind, and nourished and enriched it
with the sense of beauty,” so that his pages glow with
green, blue, red, and yellow.</p>

<p>Time, Change, Birth, Death—she, too, was floating
on their multi-coloured waters.</p>

<p>“Do you think your father is in hell?” she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>He winced.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” he answered, after a pause: “It
isn’t as if he’d seen the light and turned away from it.
I think he’ll be in Purgatory,” and he looked at her
questioningly.</p>

<p>She was touched—this young seminarist was still
quite free from the dogmatism and harshness of the
priest.</p>

<p>“You know the legend, don’t you,” she said gently,
“that the prayers of St. Gregory the Great got the soul
of the Emperor Trajan into Paradise?”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes; he was the just pagan <i>par excellence</i>, and the
prayers of St. Gregory saved his soul.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Parker came in: “Excuse me,
miss, but have you seen Miss Concha? It’s about that
old lace ... Madame wishes to see if it can be draped
without being cut.”</p>

<p>“No, Parker, I have not seen her.”</p>

<p>And Parker withdrew.</p>

<p>“I thought about that ... I mean my parents’
souls,” he went on, “when I first felt a vocation. I
thought, maybe, me being a priest might help them—not
that they weren’t a hundred times better than me—it’s
all very mysterious ...” he paused, and once
again punctuated his sentence with the ruminative
“úhu.”</p>

<p>“My mother is terribly unhappy because my eldest
sister died an atheist ... and now Concha’s having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
ratted ...” she found herself saying; herself surprised
at this abandoning of her wonted reserve.</p>

<p>“Poor lady!” he said very sympathetically; “yes,
it’s a bad business for a mother ... my aunt Jeannie,
she was an elderly lady, a good bit older than my mother.
I lived with her in Inverness when I was going to the
Academy. Well, my mother told me she had several
good offers when she was young, but she would never
marry, because she felt she just couldn’t face the responsibility
of maybe bringing a damned soul into the world
... yes, the Scotch think an awful lot about the ‘last
things.’ ... And I suppose your mother can’t do anything
to stop her?”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of a mother being able to stop
a child going its own way?”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” and he smiled: “I should think <i>you</i>
must have been most awfully wilful when you were wee,”
and he looked at her quizzically.</p>

<p>The moment when the conversation between a man
and a woman changes from the general to the personal
is always a pungent one; Teresa gave him a cool smile
and said, “How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps ... in a very quiet way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s always the worst.”</p>

<p>Then, almost as if it were a tedious duty, he harked
back to Concha’s perversion: “Yes, it’s a bad business
for you all about Miss Concha.”</p>

<p>“Life absorbs everything—in time,” said Teresa, half
to herself.</p>

<p>“What do you mean exactly by that, Miss Lane?”</p>

<p>“Heresy, probably,” and she smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s difficult to explain ... but I feel a sort of
transubstantiation always going on ... sin and mistakes
and sorrows and joy slowly, inevitably, turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
into the bread that is life, and it’s no use worrying and
struggling and trying to prevent everything but fine
flour from going in ... all’s grist that comes to the
mill.”</p>

<p>He looked at her intently for a few seconds: “Don’t
you believe in the teaching of the Church, Miss Lane?”</p>

<p>“Does it ... does it matter about believing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it matters.”</p>

<p>“Well ... I haven’t quite made up my mind.”</p>

<p>Suddenly from the garden came Concha’s voice
singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m so <i>jolly</i> glad to meet you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m so <i>jolly</i> glad you’re glad!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then one of the French-windows burst open, and in she
came, all blown by March winds, a bunch of early
daffodils in her hand, and, behind her, ’Snice, his paws
caked with mud.</p>

<p>She made Teresa think of the exquisite conceit in
which Herrick describes a wind-blown maiden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She lookt as she’d been got with child</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">By young Favonius.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Hallo! When did you arrive? It was such a
divine morning I had to go for a walk. You poor
creature—you do look thin. Oh dear, I <i>must</i> have a
cigarette.”</p>

<p>Her unnecessary heartiness probably concealed a
little embarrassment; as to him—he was perfectly
calm, grave, and friendly.</p>

<p>Then Dick came in: “Hallo! How are you, Munroe?
So sorry I wasn’t about when you arrived—had to go
down to the village to see the parson. We’ll have to
fatten you up while you’re here—shan’t we, Concha?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
I don’t know whether we can rise to <i>haggis</i>, but we’ll do
our best.”</p>

<p>Teresa felt a strange sensation of relief; here it was
back again—old, foolish, meaningless, Merry England.
She realised that, during the last half hour, she had
been in another world—it was not exactly life; and
she remembered that sense of almost frightening
incongruity when she had first heard of David’s
vocation.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Soon it was real spring: the trees became covered
with golden buds, with pale green tassels; the orchard
was a mass of white blossom; the view became streaked
with the startling greenness of young wheat; and the
long grass of the wild acre beyond the orchard was
penetrated with jonquils, and daffodils, and narcissi,
boldly pouting their corollas at birds and insects and
men. While very soon every one grew so accustomed
to the singing of the birds that one almost ceased to
<i>hear</i> it—it had entered the domain of vision, and become
a stippled background to the <i>velatura</i> of trees and
leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>David had settled down very happily at Plasencia, and
had proved himself to be a highly domesticated creature—always
ready to do odd jobs about the house or
garden.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival Concha had gone up to
Scotland to stay with Colonel Dundas, so it fell upon
Teresa to entertain him.</p>

<p>They would go for long walks; and though they talked
all the time, never, after that first conversation, did they
touch on religious matters.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would tell her of his childhood in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Scotland, and it soon became almost a part of her own
memories: the small, dark, sturdy creature in a shabby
kilt, a “poke of sweeties” in his sporran, at play with
his brothers and sisters, dropping, say, a worm-baited
bootlace into the liquid amber of the burn—their chaff,
as befitted children of the Manse, with a biblical flavour,
“Now then David, my man, no so much lip—<i>Selah, change
the tune</i>, d’ye hear?” And the hillsides tesselated with
heather and broom, and the sheep ruddled red as deer,
and the beacon of the rowans flashed from hill to hill;
while down the bland and portly Spey floated little
dreams, like toy boats, making for big towns, and the
sea, and over the sea.... Then all would melt into
the tune of the “Old Hundred”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Awl peeeople thaat own errrth dew dwell.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What time James Grant, the precentor with the trombone-voice,
rocked his Bible up and down, as though it
were a baby whose slumbers he was soothing with an
ogre lullaby.</p>

<p>All this was a far cry from his Holiness, the Immaculate
Conception, the Sacred Heart of Jesus ... and
yet ... it was not quite Plasencia; there was something
different about it all: again she remembered the
incongruity of the minarets of the Sacré-Cœur.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, he would tell her of his years in South
Africa—for instance, how, after a long day of riding up
and down the fields of sugar-cane, he would lie out on
the veranda of his little bungalow and read Dumas’s
novels, while the plangent songs of the indentured
Indians, celebrating some feast with a communal curry,
would float up from their barracks under the hill; or
else the night would shiver to the uncanny cry of a
bush-baby: “It’s a wee beastie that wails at night.
There’s no other sound like it in the world—beside it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the owl’s and the nightjar’s cries are homely and barn-door
like.”</p>

<p>“It must have been the sort of noise one would hear
if one slept in Cathy’s old room at Wuthering Heights,”
she said, half to herself.</p>

<p>“You’re right there,” he answered, “I never thought
of it, but you’re quite right,” and then he added, “it’s
a grand book, that.” And, after another pause: “Do
you realise that one never knows whether Cathy and
Heathcliff were sinners?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean? I must say they both struck
me as very wild and violent characters!”</p>

<p>“No, no, I mean <i>sinners</i>. One never knows ...
whether they broke the Seventh Commandment or not,”
and suddenly he blushed violently.</p>

<p class="tb">After tea he would take her drives in the car; it was
very peaceful rushing past squat churches with faintly
dog-toothed Norman towers, past ruined windmills,
and pollard willows, and the delicate diversity of spring
woods. Guy had once said that a motor drive in the
evening through the Eastern Counties was like Gray’s
<i>Elegy</i> cut up by a jig-saw.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as they sped along, he would sing—songs
he had learned at the front. There was one that the
Canadians had taught him, with the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Be sure and check your chewing gum</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the darkie at the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And you’ll hear some Bible stories</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That you never heard before.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was the French waltz-song, <i>Sous les Ponts de
Paris</i>, of which he only knew a few words here and
there, and these he pronounced abominably; but its
romantic wistful tune suited his voice. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
too, he would sing Zulu songs that reminded Teresa of
Spanish <i>coplas</i> sung by Seville gipsies; and sometimes
the Scottish psalms and paraphrases in metre; and
their crude versification and rugged melodious airs
struck her, accustomed to the intoning of the Latin
Psalter, as almost ridiculous. They had lost all of
what Sir Philip Sidney calls, “the psalmist’s notable
prosopopœias when he maketh you, as it were, see God
coming in His majesty”; and they made one see,
instead, a very homely God, who, in the cool of the
evening, would stroll into the crofter’s cottage, as
though it had been the tent of Abraham, and praise the
guidwife’s scones, and resolve the crofter’s theological
difficulties.</p>

<p>All this showed a robustness of conscience—he had
none of the doctrinairism and queasiness of the ordinary
convert; what mattered it to him that the songs he
sang were often <i>very</i> secular, the version of the Psalms
heavy with Presbyterianism?</p>

<p>But she was often conscious of the decades that lay
between them, the leagues and leagues, of which the
milestones were little cultured jokes at Chelsea tea-parties,
and Cambridge epigrams, and endless novels
and plays. The very language he spoke was twenty
or thirty years behind her own; such expressions as
“a very refined lady,” or “a regular earthly Paradise,”
fell from his lips with all their pristine dignity. And
yet she could talk to him simply and spontaneously as
to no one else.</p>

<p>Since he had been there she had left off reading
mediæval books, and her brain felt like a deserted hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Easter was very late that year, and the Catholics at
Plasencia were wakened very early on Easter morning
to an exquisite, soft, scented day, almost like summer.</p>

<p>Teresa, looking out of her window as she dressed, saw
that her parents were already walking in the garden.
She gazed for some seconds at her father’s sturdy back,
as he stood, as if rooted to the earth, gazing at some
minute flower in the border.</p>

<p>St. Joseph of Arimathea, she thought, may have been
just such a kindly self-indulgent person as he; dearly
loving his garden. And if her father had been asked to
allow the corpse of a young dissenter to lie in <i>his</i> garden,
though he might have grumbled, he would have been
far too good-natured to refuse. And, if that young
dissenter had turned out to be God Almighty, her father
would have turned into a Saint, and after his death his
sturdy bones would have worked miracles. She smiled
as she pictured the Doña’s indignant surprise at finding
her husband chosen for canonisation—the College of
Cardinals would have had no difficulty in obtaining an
<i>advocatus diaboli</i>.</p>

<p>And as to the garden—surely the contact of Christ’s
body would have fertilised it, a thousand times more
than Lorenzo’s head the pot of basil, making it riot into
a forest of fantastic symbolic blossoms: great racemes,
perhaps, which, with their orange-pollened pistils protruding
like flames from their seven long, white, waxy
blossoms, would recall the seven-branched candlestick
in the Temple; bell-flowers shaped like chalices and
stained crimson inside as if with blood; monstrous
veronicas, each blossom bearing the impress of the Holy
Face.</p>

<p>What an unutterably ridiculous faith it was! But,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
for good or ill, her own imagination was steeped all
through with the unfading dye of its traditions.</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs, and David drove them
through the fresh morning to mass.</p>

<p>The nearest Catholic church was in a small market-town
some ten miles distant. It was always a pleasure
to Teresa to drive through that town—it had the completeness
and finish of a small, beautifully made object
that one could turn round and round in one’s hands
and examine from every side. The cobbled market-place,
where on Saturdays cheap-jacks turned somersaults
and cracked jokes in praise of their wares, exactly
as they had done in the days of Shakespeare and Ben
Jonson; the flat Georgian houses of red brick picked
out in white and grown over with ivy, in one of which
the doctor’s daughters knitted jumpers and talked
about the plays they had seen on their last visit to
London—“a very weepie piece; playing on nothing
but the black notes, don’t you know!” the heraldic
lion on the sign of the old inn; the huge yellow poster
advertising Colman’s Mustard—it was all absorbed into
a small harmonious whole, an English story. All, that
is to say, except the large Catholic church built in the
hideous imitation Gothic of the last century, <i>that</i>
remained ever outside of it all, a great unsightly excrescence,
spoiling the harmony. It had been built with
money left for the purpose by a pious lady, who had
begun her career as a Belgian actress, and ended it as
the widow of a rich manufacturer of dolls’ eyes, who
had bought a big property in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>“I used to think when I was a child,” said Teresa,
who was sitting in front beside David, “that the relics
under the altar were small wax skulls and glass eyes.”</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her with an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p>“I believe he looks upon me as a little girl,” she said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
to herself; and she felt at once annoyed and strangely
glad.</p>

<p>Then they went into the dank, dark, candle-lit church;
and it was indeed as if they had suddenly stepped on to
a different planet.</p>

<p>A few minutes of waiting—and then mass had
begun.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Resurrexi, et adhuc tecum sum, alleluia; posuisti
super me manum tuam, alleluia: mirabilis facta est
scientia tua, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

</div>

<p>She sat beside David, dreamily telling her beads, and
glancing from time to time at her Missal.</p>

<p>With signings, and genuflexions, and symbolic
kisses, the chorus in their sexless vestments sang the
amœbæan pre-Thespian drama—verses strung together
from David and Isaiah that hinted at a plot, but did
not even <i>tell</i> a story ... till suddenly in the <i>Sequentia</i>
an actor broke loose from the chorus, and tragedy was
born:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Victimæ Paschali laudes immolent Christiani. Agnus
redemit oves: Christus innocens Patri reconciliavit
peccatores. Mors et vita duello conflixere mirando:
dux vitæ; mortuus regnat vivus.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea came to her that this too was a play,
in the particular sense that she wished her own reactions
to be a play, that is to say a squeezing into a plot of the
manifold manifestations of Life; and, if one chose to
play on words, a plot <i>against</i> Life, as well: pruning,
pruning, discarding, shaping, till the myriad dreams
and aspirations of man, the ceaseless struggle, through
chemists’ retorts, through the earth of gardens, through
the human brain, of the Unknown to become the Known
was reduced to an imaginary character called God; a
nailing of the myriad ways by which man can become
happy and free to a wooden cross a few cubits high; a
reducing of his myriad forms of spiritual sustenance to
a tiny wafer of flour; a tampering, too, with the past,
saying “in the beginning <i>was</i> ...” but Life, noisy,
tangible, resilient, supple, cunning Life, was laughing out
there in the streets and fields at the makers of myths;
for it knew that every plot against it was foredoomed
to failure.</p>

<p>Then they went up to the altar; and, kneeling between
the Doña and David, she received the host on her tongue.</p>

<p>The Holy Mother—Celestina, the old wise courtesan
of Spain, skilled beyond all others in the distilling of
perfumes, in the singing of spells—she was luring her
back, she was luring her back ... in odore unguentorum
tuorum curremus ... what cared Celestina that
it was by the senses and the imagination that she held
her victims instead of by the reason?</p>

<p>The Rock ... Peter’s Rock ... a Prometheus
bound to it for ever, though the vulture should eat out
her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>On the drive home Jollypot, who was sitting behind
beside the Doña, remarked meditatively, “How
lovely the Easter <i>Sequentia</i> is!... so sudden and
dramatic!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the Doña, who never failed to be
irritated by Jollypot’s enthusiasm over the literary
aspect of the Liturgy. “Oh, look at these trees!
Everything is so very early.”</p>

<p>“I was following in my Missal,” Jollypot went on,
“and I was suddenly struck by the words: Agnus
redemit oves—the lamb redeems the sheep—they seemed
to me <i>so</i> lovely: and I wondered ... I wondered if
it weren’t always so ... the lamb redeeming the sheep,
I mean ... ‘and a little child shall lead them,’
if ...” and she lowered her voice, “if little Jasper
with his devotion to the Blessed Sacrament should redeem
... dear Pepa’s lamb ... do you think?...”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you mean, Jollypot?” said the Doña
severely.</p>

<p>“Well, I was wondering, dear Mrs. Lane ... if
his wonderful child piety ...; if it ... if it mightn’t
help dear Pepa.”</p>

<p>The Doña gave a snort: “The words in the <i>Sequentia</i>,
Jollypot, refer to Christ and the Church—what <i>could</i>
they have to do with Jasper and Pepa?” and she gave
an involuntary sigh.</p>

<p>“What do you think of our seminarist?” she asked
after a pause, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Jollypot, though she had lived with the Doña for
years, had not yet learned to know when her voice was
ironical:</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he’s a <i>dear</i> fellow,” she said enthusiastically,
“so <i>big</i> and <i>simple</i>, and <i>child-like</i> and <i>rugged</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
such a jolly voice! And sometimes, too, he’s so
<i>pawky</i>—oh, I think he’s a <i>delightful</i> fellow.”</p>

<p>The Doña gave a tiny shrug: “He seems to like
staying with us very much,” she said drily.</p>

<p>“But how could he help it? You are all so jolly to
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes; some of us are very hospitable,” and the
Doña’s eyes rested for a moment on Teresa’s back;
“still, one would have thought he might have recovered
from his influenza by now.”</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Anna and Jasper came to Plasencia for their Easter
holidays, and towards the end of April Concha and
Rory got back from Scotland. It was the first time
Teresa had seen them together since their engagement,
and their relationship was so comfortable and intimate
that, to her, it almost smacked of incest.</p>

<p>As to the Doña, the presence of Rory in the flesh
seemed to undo all the reconciliatory work of the past
two months, and her attitude once more became uncompromising,
her heart bitter and heavy.</p>

<p>Harry and Arnold came down for the last “week-end”
in April; so they were now quite a big party
again, and Teresa did not see so much of David.</p>

<p>It was dear that Concha was bursting with the
glories of Drumsheugh; but she had no one to tell them
to; the Doña and Teresa were out of the question, and
Arnold had sulked with her ever since her engagement.
However, one afternoon when they were sitting in the
loggia, she could keep it in no longer: “I simply <i>love</i>
Drumsheugh,” she began; Arnold immediately started
talking to Harry, but to her surprise she found Teresa
clearly prepared to listen sympathetically. “It isn’t
a ‘stately home of England’ sort of thing, you know,
but square and plain and solid, and full of solid Victorian
furniture; and the portraits aren’t ruffles and armour
and that sort of thing, but eighteenth-century-judges-sort-of-people.
There’s a perfectly divine Raeburn of
Rory’s great-great-grandmother playing ring-o’-roses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
with her children. It’s altogether <i>very</i> eighteenth
century ... the sort of house one can imagine Dr.
Johnson staying in, when he was in Scotland, and very
much enjoying the claret and library. And there’s no
‘culture’ about it—it’s filled with cases of stuffed birds,
and stuffed foxes and things....”</p>

<p>“<i>What</i>, Concha?” cried Arnold, breaking off in the
middle of his sentence to Harry, “did you say <i>stuffed
foxes</i>? I never thought much of the Scotch, but I
didn’t think they were as bad as that. Do you really
shoot foxes in Scotland, Dundas?”</p>

<p>Since the engagement he had gone back to calling
Rory, “Dundas.”</p>

<p>Rory was speechless with laughter: “Oh, Concha!
What <i>are</i> you talking about?” he spluttered, and poor
Concha, who, since her engagement, had gone in for
being a sporting character, blushed crimson.</p>

<p>For the first time Teresa saw something both pretty
and touching in Concha’s attitude to life: as a little
girl-guide, an Anna, in fact, passionately collects,
badges for efficiency in heterogeneous activities—sewing,
playing <i>God Save the King</i> on the piano, gardening,
tennis, reciting Kipling’s <i>If</i>; so Concha collected the
various manifestations of “grown-up-ness”—naughty
stories, technical and sporting expressions, scandal
about well-known people; and it was all, really, so
innocent.</p>

<p>“You got on very well with Colonel Dundas, didn’t
you?” she said, turning the subject to what she knew
was a source of gratification.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she scored heavily with Uncle Jimmy,”
said Rory proudly. “He’s in love with her—<i>really</i> in
love with her. But I don’t know whether that’s much
of a triumph—he’s the bore of ten clubs.”</p>

<p>Concha began to count on her fingers: “The Senior,
the Travellers’, Hurlingham, ... er....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“The Conservative Club, Edinburgh,” prompted
Rory.</p>

<p>“The Conservative, Edinburgh—what’s the St.
Andrews one?”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Royal</span> and <span class="smcap">Ancient</span>, you goose!” he roared.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course, Royal and Ancient. Then the
North Berwick one—that’s six. Then there’s....”</p>

<p>At that moment the Doña arrived for tea, cutting
them off for the time from this grotesque source of
pride; as in her presence there could be no talk of
Drumsheugh and “Uncle Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the garden <i>is</i> forging ahead. What I like is
roses; do you think this will be a good year for them?
But I do like them to have a smell.”</p>

<p>“Guy says that Shakespeare is wrong and that there
<i>is</i> something in a name, and that the reason they don’t
smell so sweet now is that they’re called by absurd
names like ‘Hugh Dickson’ and ‘Frau Karl Druschke.’”</p>

<p>“Well, how does he explain that Frau Karl has been
called ‘Snow Queen’ since the War and still hasn’t any
smell?”</p>

<p>“By the way, where <i>is</i> Guy? We haven’t seen him
since the dance at Christmas. Do you remember how
queer he was the next morning?”</p>

<p>“He’s been in Spain, but he should be back soon,”
said Arnold, with a resentful look at Teresa.</p>

<p>Then Anna and Jasper trotted across the lawn and
on to the loggia, both very grubby; Jasper carrying a
watering-can.</p>

<p>“We’ve been gardening,” said Anna proudly.</p>

<p>“That ... er ... is a ... er ... self-evident
proposition that needs no demonstration, as the dogs’-meat
man said to the cook when she ... er ... told
him he wasn’t a gentleman,” quoted Harry.</p>

<p>“Darlings, isn’t it time for your own tea? And
what <i>would</i> Nanny say? You really oughtn’t to come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
to grown-up tea without washing your hands,” protested
Teresa—in vain; for the Doña had already provided
each of them with a large slice of cake.</p>

<p>Then Jasper’s roving eye perched upon David,
meditatively stirring his tea. He began to snigger:
“Silly billy! <i>You</i> can’t make flowers grow. Anna
says so.”</p>

<p>“Jasper! Don’t be so silly,” said Anna, reddening.</p>

<p>“But you <i>said</i> so,” whined Jasper.</p>

<p>“What’s this? What’s it all about?” laughed
Rory.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Anna sulkily.</p>

<p>“Now then; out with it, old thing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, darling, why should Mr. Munroe make flowers
grow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” and Anna blushed again, “You see, it was
about holy water. I thought if it was <i>really</i> like that
Mr. Munroe might bless the water in our watering-can,
so that they’d all grow up in the night ... just to show
whether it was true or not, you know.”</p>

<p>Harry looked round with an unmistakable expression
of paternal pride; Dick, Arnold, Concha and Rory
exploded into their several handkerchiefs; Jollypot
murmured, “Dear little girl!” The Doña looked
sphinx-like; and Teresa glanced nervously at David.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Anna, but I fear I can’t do that
for you—for one thing, I’m not yet a priest,” he answered,
blushing crimson.</p>

<p>“By the way, Mr. Munroe, when <i>are</i> you going to be
ordained?” asked the Doña suavely. “Let me see ...
it <i>could</i> be in September, Our Lady’s birth month,
couldn’t it? I read an article by a Jesuit Father the
other day about the ‘Save the Vocations Fund,’ and
he said there was no birthday gift so acceptable to
Our Lady as the first mass of a young priest.”</p>

<p>The Doña rarely if ever spoke upon matters of faith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
in public; so Teresa felt that her words had a definite
purpose, and were spoken with concealed malice.</p>

<p>“Good God!” muttered Harry; then, turning to
Arnold, he said—“it’s ... it’s ... <i>astounding</i>. Birthday
presents of young priests! It’s like the Mountain
Mother and her Kouretes!” He spoke in a very low
voice; but Teresa overheard.</p>

<p>The smell of this half ridiculous, half sinister, little
incident soon evaporated from the atmosphere, and the
usual foolish, placid Plasencia talk gurgled happily on:</p>

<p>“Well, if this weather goes on we ought soon to be
getting the tennis-court marked ... oh Lord! I wish
it was easier to get exercise in this place.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure Anna and Jasper would be only too
delighted to race you round the lawn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, didn’t you say there was a <i>real</i>
tennis court somewhere in this neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it belongs to a noble lord ... oh, by the
way, Dad, have you had that field rolled? If there’s
to be hay in it this year, it really ought to be, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but a heifer’s far more valuable after she’s
calved, far better wait.”</p>

<p>“Does Buckingham Palace make its own light or get
it from the town?”</p>

<p>“From the town, I should think.”</p>

<p>“What happens then if there’s a strike of the electric
light people?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a great thought! Worthy of Anna.”</p>

<p>“It’s a curious thing that ... er ... a reference
to ... er ... <span class="smcap">liquid</span> in any form inevitably tickles
an undergraduate: if I ... er ... er ... happen
to remark in a lecture that ... er ... <span class="smcap">moisture</span> is
necessary to a plant, the room ... er ... <span class="smcap">rocks with
laughter for five minutes</span>!”</p>

<p>And so on, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>But for Teresa, the shadow of that <i>other</i> plot had
fallen over the silver and china and tea-cups, over the
healthy English faces, over the tulips and wallflowers
in the garden; and over the quiet view, made by the
sowing and growing and reaping of the sunbrowned
rain-washed year; but it has a ghost—the other;
shadowy Liturgical Year, whose fields are altars in dim
churches and whose object, by means of inarticulate
chants and hierophantic gestures, is to blow some cold
life into a still-born Idea, then to let it die, then, by a
febrile reiteration of psalms and prophecies, to galvanise
it again into life.</p>

<p>And David, sitting there a little apart, though he
could talk ably about business and economics and
agriculture—he was merely a character in the Plot.
He was like a ghost, but a ghost that dwarfed and
unsubstantialised the living. He was a true son of
that race—her race, too, through the “dark Iberians”—who,
carrying their secret in their hearts, were driven
by the Pagans into the fastnesses of the hills, the hills
whence, during silent centuries, they drew the strength
of young men’s dreams, the strength of old men’s
visions, and within whose cup quietly, unceasingly, they
plied their secret craft: turning bread into God. And
though in time St. Patrick (so says one of the legends),
betrayed the secret to Ireland, and St. Columba, his
descendant in Christ, to England, and they, the men
of the Scottish hills, lost all memory of it in harsh and
homely heresies, yet once it had been theirs—theirs only.</p>

<p>Yes; but it was all nonsense—a myth, a plot. She
was becoming hag-ridden again; she must be careful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>One afternoon in the beginning of May, when Teresa
came on to the loggia at tea-time, she found no one
there but David, sitting motionless. He looked at her
gravely, and said:</p>

<p>“The doctor came this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Did he? What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said I was all right now.”</p>

<p>“That’s splendid.”</p>

<p>“So ... I must be getting back.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I’ve no right to stay a minute longer
than I need. And so ... if it’s convenient ... well,
really, I should be going to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Should you?” And there was the minimum of
conventional regret in her voice, “I’ll tell Rendall to
pack for you.”</p>

<p>“I can pack for myself ... thank you,” he said
gruffly.</p>

<p>They were silent. His eyes absently swept over the
view, then the border, and then lingered for a few
seconds on the double row of ancient hawthorns, which,
before the days of Plasencia and its garden, had stood
on either side of a lane leading to a vanished village,
and then fastened on the gibbous moon, pressed, like
the petal of a white rose, against the blue sky, idly
enjoying, as it were from the wings, the fragrance and
tempered sunshine, while it waited for its cue to come
on and play for the millionth millionth time its rôle of
the amorous potent ghost.</p>

<p>“You’ve all been very kind to me ... you, specially,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Oh ... it’s been a pleasure,” she answered dully.</p>

<p>“I’d like—if you could do with me—to come back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
for a wee visit in the summer ... before I say
my first mass.” Then he added, with a little smile,
“but maybe your mother won’t want to have me.”</p>

<p>“Oh ... I’m sure ... she’d be delighted,” she
said, with nervous little catch in her voice.</p>

<p>He looked at her, squarely, sombrely: “No, she
wouldn’t be delighted ... but I’ll come all the same,”
and he gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“Are you ... you ... when are you going to be
ordained?”</p>

<p>“It will be the beginning of October, I think,” and
again his eyes wandered absently over the view, the
border, the hedge of hawthorn; and her eyes followed
his.</p>

<p>The Plot ... the Popish Plot.... “Please to
remember the fifth of November,” ... how many
times Guy Fawkes must have been burned in that
vanished village! On frosty nights when the lamp-light
and fire-light glowed through the cosy red curtains
of the inn parlour, and the boys wore red worsted
mufflers, and stamped to keep their feet warm, and held
their hands out to the flame of the bonfire. For they
had been wise English people who had lived a hundred
years ago in that vanished village; <i>they</i> had known
what it all came to: that there was Spring, Summer,
Autumn, Winter, then Spring again; that there was
good ale to be had at the Saracen’s Head, for the paying;
that Goody Green, who kept the shop, gave short
measure, but this did not cause her to be pinched by
elves, nor to come to a bad end; that the parson was
a kind man, though a wheezy one, and liked his glass
of ale, and that whatever he might say in his sermons,
the daffodil, at any rate, <i>died</i> on Easter Day; that very
few of the wives and mothers had gone to Church maids,
but they were none the worse for that, while Marjory
from the farm up by Hobbett’s Corner hadn’t gone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
Church at all, because she had been seduced by a fine
young gentleman staying at the Saracen’s Head to
shoot wild duck, and that, in consequence, she had gone
away to London, where she had married a grocer’s
apprentice, who became in time an alderman, and drove
her about in a fine coach; that William Hobson ran
away to sea, and was never heard of again; that Stan
Huckle had emigrated to America, whence he wrote
that he had become a Methodist, because they had
strawberry festivals with lumps of frozen cream in their
chapel; in fact, that it was no use seeking for meanings
and morals, because there were none. And then, one
Spring, Summer, Autumn or Winter, one took to one’s
bed, and after a time one’s toes grew cold, and the
room grew dark, and one heard a voice saying: “Paw
ole man! The end’s near now. Well, it’ll be a blessed
release—reely.” And that was all, except, before the
dim eyes closed, a memory ... or was it the sudden
scent of May? Once long ago, in that hawthorn lane,
beneath the moon, migratory dreams had seemed to
flock together from all quarters like homing birds, and
the Future had suddenly sprung up, and all the stars
snowed down on it, till it too was a hawthorn bush
covered with a million small white blossoms, in which,
next spring, the birds would build their nests.</p>

<p>“I have noticed,” she said, “the Scotch have a great
sense of the ‘sinfulness of sin.’”</p>

<p>“Yes ... I think that’s true,” he answered.</p>

<p>“St. Paul invented sin, I suppose; Jesus didn’t.”</p>

<p>“St. Paul invent sin! You know that’s not true—it’s
as old as apples,” and he smiled down on her with
that tender, indulgent smile that made her feel like a
little girl.</p>

<p class="tb">At tea he told the Doña what the doctor had said:</p>

<p>“And so I’ll not trespass any longer on your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
hospitality, Mrs. Lane,” he added, with the laborious
gentility probably learnt from his aunt in Inverness.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it has been a great pleasure having you,”
said the Doña, with more geniality than she had shown
him for weeks, “I’m sure we shall all miss you—shan’t
we, Teresa?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we shall,” she answered, in a calm, cool
voice; no tinge of colour touching her pale cheeks, but
a sudden spark of hostility and triumph leaping into her
eyes as she met those of the Doña.</p>

<p>“I should like to come and see you all again, before
I say my first mass,” he said, looking the Doña squarely
in the face.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes ... certainly ... but we generally go
away in the summer.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking ... the end of September,
maybe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll sure to be back by then,” cut in Dick,
always on the alert to take the edge off his wife’s
grudging invitations, “Yes, you come to us at the
end of September; though, for the sake of the children’s
garden, it’s a pity it couldn’t be <i>after</i> your
ordination!”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The weather was so warm that after dinner they went
and sat out upon the lawn; but about half-past nine
the elders found it chilly and went indoors.</p>

<p>“What about a walk?” said Concha, getting up.</p>

<p>“Good scheme!” said Rory.</p>

<p>“Are you coming, darling?” she asked Teresa, going
up to her and laying her soft cheek against hers.</p>

<p>“No, Puncher, I don’t think so,” she said, smiling up
at her; and she was touched to see how she flushed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
with pleasure at the old, childish pet-name, grown, these
last years, so unfamiliar.</p>

<p>So Teresa and David sat on together, watching Concha
and Rory glimmering down the border till they melted
into the invisible view.</p>

<p>It was a glorious night. The lawns of the sky were
dusty with the may of stars. The moon, no longer
flower-like and idle, shone a cold masterpiece of metallurgy.
The air was laden with the perfumes of shrubs
and flowers. Teresa noticed that the perfumes did not
come simultaneously, but one after another; like
notes of a tune picked out with one finger—lilac, may,
wallflower....</p>

<p>“I can smell sweetbriar!” cried David suddenly, a
strange note of triumph in his voice, “it’s like a Scotch
tune—‘Oh, my love is like a red red rose’!” and he
laughed, a little wildly.</p>

<p>Teresa’s heart began to beat very fast, and seizing
at random upon the first words that occurred to her,
she said, “Concha’s like a red red rose,” and began
to repeat mechanically:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Red as a rose is she;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nodding their heads before her goes</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The merry minstrelsy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of her ...” he said. “I
wasn’t ... Oh, my love is like the rose of Sharon and
the lily of the valley ... it’s all the same”; and then,
abruptly: “Look! There’s the moon. She’s always
the same—Scotland, Africa, in the trenches, here. She’s
like books—Homer and the rest—in whatever land you
open them, they just say the same thing that they did
a hundred years ago.”</p>

<p>Far away a night-express flashed and shrieked
through the view; then an owl hooted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“So you are going back to-morrow,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes.... Hark! There’s the sweetbriar again,”
and he began to sing triumphantly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And I will come again, my Love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tho’ it were ten thousand mile.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He turned and looked at her with strangely shining
eyes: “I hear you through the wall, getting up and
going to bed every night and every morning. It makes
me feel sick sometimes, like the smell of iodoform at
the front; that’s a nice way of putting it!” and again
he laughed wildly: “like the smell of sweetbriar!
like the smell of the mass! Good-night,” and he got
up hurriedly and strode towards the house. Then he
came back: “Get up and come in,” he said gently;
“it’s getting cold and damp,” and he pulled her up
with a cool, firm hand.</p>

<p>They went in, lit their candles in the hall and said
good-night at their bedroom doors; quietly, distantly.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>David left early next morning; a stiff, genteel
little letter of thanks came from him to the Doña,
and then, for most of them, he might never have
been.</p>

<p>Each day life at Plasencia became more and more
focused on the approaching wedding; and the Doña
and Jollypot spent hours in the morning-room making
lists of guests and writing invitations.</p>

<p>As soon as David had gone Teresa began to write—the
mediæval books had done their work and were no
longer needed.</p>

<p>St. Ignatius de Loyóla, in his esoteric instructions to
his disciples, gives the following receipt for conjuring
up a vision of Christ Crucified: to obtain a vision, he
says, one must begin by visualising the background—first,
then, conjure up before you a great expanse of
intensely blue sky, such as the sky must be in Palestine,
next, picture against this sky a range of harsh, deeply
indented hills, red and green and black, then wait; and
suddenly upon this background will flash a cross with
Christ nailed to it.</p>

<p>Teresa had got her background; and now the vision
came.</p>

<p>But she was doubtful as to whether it was a vision
of the Past such as De Quincey had had in his dream,
or Monticelli shown in his picture; for one thing, she
found an almost irresistible pleasure in intagliating
her writing with antiquarian details, and indeed it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
was more a vision of a <i>situation</i>, a situation adorned
by the Past, than a vision of the Past itself.</p>

<p>She wrote all day; neither thinking nor reading,
but closely guarding her mind from the contamination
of outside ideas.</p>

<p>The play—the plot—was turning out very differently
from what she had expected; and as well as being a
transposing of life at Plasencia, it was, she realised with
the clear-sightedness of her generation, performing the
function assigned to dreams by Freud—namely, that of
expressing in symbols the desires of which one is ashamed....
Though, for her own reasons, she shrank from it,
she was keenly aware of Concha’s sympathy these days.
It seemed that Concha had that rare, mysterious gift
that Pepa had had too—the gift of loving.</p>

<p>Guy came down in June for a week-end; with Teresa
he was like a sulky child, but she saw that his eyes
were haggard, and she felt very sorry for him.</p>

<p>“What about that Papist—I mean Roman Catholic,
the stolid Scot?” he asked at tea.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he’s all right. He’s a dear thing ...”
said Concha, hurriedly flinging herself into the breach.</p>

<p>Teresa saw the Doña fumbling for her <i>lorgnette</i>. She
had found her <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Guy after his arrival—had
she been saying anything to him?</p>

<p>“Uncomfortable, half-baked creature!” said Guy
angrily; “he’s like a certain obscure type of undergraduate
that used to lurk in the smaller colleges. They
were so obscure that no one had ever so much as seen
them, but their praises would be sung by even more
obscure, though, unfortunately, less invisible admirers,
who wore things which I’m sure they called <i>pince-nez</i>,
and ran grubby societies, and they would stop one at
lectures—simply sweating with enthusiasm—to tell one
that Clarke, or Jones, or whatever the creature’s name
was, had read a <i>marvellous</i> paper on Edward Carpenter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
or Tagore at the Neolithic Pagans, or that it was Clarke
that had made some disgusting little arts-and-crafts
Madonna on the chimneypiece. And then years later
you hear that Clarke is chief of a native tribe in one of
the islands of the Pacific, or practising yoga in Burmah
... some mysterious will to adventure, I suppose, but
all so inconceivably indiscriminating and obscure and
half-baked! Well, at any rate, the veil of obscurity
has been rent and at last I have seen “Clarke” in the
flesh!” and he ended his shrill, gabbled complaint with
a petulant laugh.</p>

<p>“He’s not in the least like that, Guy,” laughed
Concha; “he’s more like some eighteenth-century
highland shepherd teaching himself Greek out of a Greek
Testament,” she added, rather prettily.</p>

<p>“Yes, and having religious doubts, which are resolved
by an examination of the elaborate anatomy of a
horse’s skull found on the moors—it’s all the same,
only more picturesque.”</p>

<p>“And why are you so angry with our friend Mr.
Munroe, Guy?” asked the Doña.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know! I’m like Nietsche, I hate
‘women, cows, Scotsmen, and all democrats,’” and he
gave an irritated little wriggle.</p>

<p>How waspish the little creature had become! But
who can draw up a scale of suffering and say that an
aching heart is easier to bear than a wounded vanity?</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t told us anything about Spain,”
said Concha.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing to tell ... it’s a threadbare
theme; <i>Childe Harold</i> has already been written....
Of course, the theme of Don Juan lends itself to perennial
treatment....”</p>

<p>The Doña laughed softly: “But it is so unjust that
Don Juan Tenorio is supposed only to be found in
Spain!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“No more unjust than that Jesus Christ should be
looked upon as a Jew.”</p>

<p>“<i>Guy!</i>”</p>

<p>“That is really the <i>comble</i> to the insults we have put
upon that unfortunate people.”</p>

<p>“Guy! I will <i>not</i> have you speaking like that in
my house,” said the Doña very sternly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he muttered, in some confusion;
and then took up his shrill monologue: “As a
matter of fact, Don Juan is the greatest glory of Spain;
he is own brother to Sancho Panza—a superb pair;
they are the true αὐτόχθων, made of the mud of <i>this</i>
planet, and they understand life as it is meant to be
lived down here. The rest of us shriek, like Coleridge,
for a ‘bread not made of wheat’.... Yes, we behave
idiotically, like creatures in some fable that has not
yet been written, when we want cheese for supper, we
take our bow and arrows and go and shoot at the moon—the
moon, which is the cradle of the English race....”
On and on went his voice, the others sitting round in
silence, to conceal their embarrassment or boredom.</p>

<p>“To return to Don Juan, I see there is a new theory
that he is an <i>Eniautos Daimon</i>—one of those year-spirits
that die every winter and vegetation dies with
them, and are born again in spring with the crops and
things ... seeds, and crops and souls dying and
springing up again with Don Juan. So there is hope
for us all, <i>sic itur ad astra</i>—rakes during our life, manure
afterwards; so horticultural! I wonder if our friend
Mr. Munroe would make a good year-spirit?”</p>

<p>This time they had beaten her: the blood rushed to
Teresa’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“I expect he would only be able to make oats grow—‘man’s
food in Scotland,’” laughed Concha, as if it
were merely the ordinary Plasencia bandying of conceits;
“I think Dad would make a better one,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
added; “he’s so good about flowers and crops and
things, and the farmers and people say he has ‘green
fingers,’ because everything he plants is sure to grow.”</p>

<p>Teresa felt sincerely grateful to her: she had cooled
the situation, and, as well, had given the whole conversation
about Don Juan an amazing significance; the
play would have to be re-cast.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>On Monday morning Teresa had a little talk with
Guy before he went away—after all, he was but a
fantastic little creature, powerless to hurt her; and he
was suffering.</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross with me, Guy,” she said, laying her
hand on his sleeve; “it’s so difficult to feel ... to feel
as you want me to ... you see, it’s so difficult with
some one one has known so many years; besides, you
know, you can’t have it both ways,” and she smiled.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” he asked sulkily.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, you’re a poet. We take <i>poetry</i>
seriously, but sometimes we ... well, we smile a little
at <i>poets</i>. <i>Sub specie æternitatis</i>—isn’t that the expression?
You are <i>sub specie æternitatis</i>, and the worst of
being under that species is that both one’s value and
one’s values are apt to be ... well, snowed over by
the present. Milton’s daughters, at the actual moment
that they were grumbling about having to have <i>Paradise
Lost</i> dictated to them, were really quite justified—the
darning of their fichus or ... or young Praise-the-Lord
Simpkins waiting for them by the stile were
much more important <i>at that moment</i>. It’s only afterwards,
when all these things—the young man, the stile
and the fichus—have turned long ago into dust, and
<i>Paradise Lost</i> grows more glorious every year, that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
turn into frivolous, deplorable fools. You can’t have
it both ways, old Guy.”</p>

<p>Her instinct had been true—this was the only possible
balm.</p>

<p>Now, at last, he knew what she really thought of
him—she mentioned him in the same breath with
Milton; she thought him a genius.</p>

<p>He felt wildly happy and excited, but, of course, he
did not allow this to show in his face.</p>

<p>Then he looked at her: the pointed arch her mouth
went into when she smiled; the beautiful oval teeth,
the dark, rather weary eyes, for the moment a tender,
slightly quizzical smile lurking in their corners ...
oh! he wanted this creature for his own; he <i>must</i> get
her.</p>

<p class="tb">“What about this thing you’re writing?” he asked
with a little gulp.</p>

<p>“What thing?”</p>

<p>“Concha said you were writing something. What
is it ... a ‘strong’ novel?”</p>

<p>“It’s ... it’s historical, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see—‘historical fiction.’”</p>

<p>“It isn’t fiction at all; it’s a play.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, may I read it?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! It isn’t finished ... it....”</p>

<p>“We must get it acted, when it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” and she shrank back, as if he had
threatened to strike her.</p>

<p>“Of course it must be acted; it’s <i>much</i> better than
having to struggle with publishers, that’s the devil—cracking
one’s knuckles against the Bodley Head, tilting
with Mr. Heinemann’s Windmill, foundering in Mr.
Murray’s Ship ... it’s....”</p>

<p>“But nothing would induce me to have it either
published or acted. It’s just for myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but you’ll change your mind when it’s finished—it’s
biological, one can’t help it; the act of parturition
isn’t complete till the thing is published or produced—you’ll
see. I was up at Cambridge with the chap who
has started this company of strolling players—they’re
very ‘cultured’ and ‘pure’ and all that sort of thing,
but they don’t act badly. If you send it to him, I’ll
tell him he must produce it. They might come and do
it here—on the lawn.”</p>

<p>“No! no! no!” she cried in terror, “I couldn’t
bear it. I don’t want it acted at all.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, a little impishly: “You mark my
words, it <i>will</i> be acted ... here on the lawn.”</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>It was the eve of Concha’s wedding; the house was full,
and overflowing into Rudge’s cottage, into Rendall’s
cottage, and into the houses of neighbours: there were
Guy and his parents, Sir Roger and Lady Cust, there was
Colonel Dundas, there was “Crippin” Arbuthnot, Rory’s
major who was to be best man, and Elfrida Penn, who
was to be chief bridesmaid, and Harry Sinclair and his
children, and Hugh Mallam and Dick’s cousin and
partner, Edward Lane.</p>

<p>A wedding is a <i>thing</i>—as concrete and compact as a
gold coin stamped with a date and a symbol; for,
though of the substance of Time, it has the qualities of
Matter; colour, shape, tangibleness. Or rather, perhaps
it freezes Time into the semblance of Eternity, but does
not rob it of its colours: these it keeps as Morris’s gods
did theirs in the moonlight.</p>

<p>We have all awakened on a winter’s morning to the
fantastic joke that during the night a heavy fall of
snow has played on Space; just such a joke does a
wedding play on Time.</p>

<p>And who can keep out the <i>estantigua</i>, the demon
army of the restless dead, screaming in the wind and led
by Hellequin?</p>

<p>Now Hellequin is the old romance form of Harlequin,
and Harlequin leads the wedding revels. But it is in
vain that, like Ophelia, he “turns life, death and fate
into prettiness and favour”: we recognise the eyes
behind the mask, we know of what army he is captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>And the wedding guests themselves; though each,
individually, was anodyne, even commonplace, yet,
under that strange light, they were fantastic, sinister—they
were <i>folk</i>.</p>

<p>In her childhood that word had always terrified
Teresa—there was her old nightmare of the Canterbury
Pilgrims, knight, franklin, wife of Bath, streaming down
the chimney with strange mocking laughter to keep
Walpurgis-night in a square tiled kitchen.... Bishops,
priests, deacons, sub-deacons, acolytes, exorcists,
lectors, confessors, virgins, widows, and all the holy
people of God.</p>

<p>Yes, they were <i>folk</i>.</p>

<p>How pawky Edward Lane was looking—uncannily
humorous and shrewd! What six-plied, cynical thing
was he about to say to Jasper?</p>

<p>However, what he did say was: “You don’t get
cake like that at school—do you, young man?”</p>

<p>And Lady Cust, with her light rippling laugh
and her observant eyes—noticing the cut of one’s
skirt and whether one asked her if she <i>took</i> sugar
in her tea—when her face was in repose it was sad,
like that of a Christian slave in the land of the
Saracens.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, when we were in Pau we motored over to
Lourdes, when one of the pilgrimages was on. Some
of them ... well, really, they were like goblins, poor
creatures ... appalling!” and she actually smiled
reminiscently.</p>

<p>Teresa remembered Guy’s having told her that the
favourite amusement of his Brabazon uncles when they
were drunk had been potting with their revolvers at the
village idiot.</p>

<p>She looked at Colonel Dundas: solemn, heavy, with
a walrus moustache, and big, owl-like spectacles, each
glass bisected with a straight line; at Sir Roger Cust,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
a dapper “hard-bitten” little man, with small, sharp
gray eyes—surely <i>they</i> were not sinister.</p>

<p>“Old Tommy Cunningham!” Sir Roger was saying;
“that takes one a long way back. Wasn’t he Master
at one time of the Linlithgowshire?”</p>

<p>“Yes ... from eighteen ... eighteen seventy-five,
I think, to eighty ... eighty-<i>six</i>, I think. I couldn’t
tell you for certain, off-hand, but I’ll look it up in my
diary,” said Colonel Dundas; “he was a first-rate shot,
too,” he added.</p>

<p>“Magnificent!” agreed Sir Roger, “Aye, úhu, aye,
úhu. D’you remember how he used always to say
that?”</p>

<p>“So he did! Picked it up from the keepers and
gillies, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“He was the coolest chap I’ve ever known. Do you
remember his mare White Heather?”</p>

<p>“Yes ... let me see ... she was out of Lady of
the Lake, by ... by....”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s the one. Well, you know, he had
<i>thousands</i> on her for the National, and I was standing
near him, and when she came in ... third, I think it
was....”</p>

<p>“Fourth I <i>think</i>, but....”</p>

<p>“Fourth, then. Well, old Tommy just shut up his
glasses with a snap and said, ‘Aye, úhu, well, poor lassie,
<i>I</i> thought she’d win somehow.’ Didn’t turn a hair, and
he’d thousands on her!”</p>

<p>They were silent for a few seconds; then Sir Roger
sighed and smiled: “Well, all that was a long time
ago, Jimmy. <i>Eheu fugaces, Posthume, Posthume</i>....
Isn’t that how it goes, Guy? Funny how these old tags
stick in one’s mind!” and he rubbed his chin and smiled
complacently; and Teresa felt sure he would wake up
in the night and chuckle with pride over the aptness
of his Latin quotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Yes, but what was “old Tommy Cunningham” doing
here? For he brought with him a rush of dreams and
of old cold hopes, and a world as dead as the moon—dead
men, dead horses, dead hounds.</p>

<p>Aye, úhu, fugax es, Cunningham, Cunningham.</p>

<p>“Don’t you adore albinos?” shrilled Elfrida Penn
in her peacock scream, while that intensely conventional
little man, “Crippin” Arbuthnot grew crimson to the
top of his bald head, and Lady Cust’s face began to
twitch—clearly, she was seized by a violent desire to
giggle.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to go up to your room, Lady
Cust? You must be tired,” said the Doña.</p>

<p>“Well, thank you very much, perhaps it would be
a good plan; though it’s difficult to tear oneself away
from this lovely garden—<i>How</i> you must love it!” and
she turned to Teresa; then again to the Doña: “I
have been envying you your delphiniums—they’re much
finer than ours, ain’t they, Roger? Do you cinder
them in the spring?” and they began walking towards
the house, talking about gardens; but all the time they
were watching each other, wary, alert, hostile.</p>

<p>“What a delicious room! And such roses!” Lady
Cust exclaimed when they reached her bedroom.</p>

<p>Her maid had already unpacked; and on her dressing-table
was unfurled one of these folding series of leather
photograph frames, and each one contained a photograph
of Francis, her eldest son, who had been killed in
the War. There were several of him in the uniform of
the Rifle Brigade; one of him in cricket flannels, one
on a horse, two or three in khaki; a little caricature
of him had also been unpacked, done by a girl in their
neighbourhood, when he was a Sandhurst cadet; at
the bottom of it was scrawled in a large, unsophisticated
feminine hand: <i>Wishing you a ripping Xmas</i>, and then
two or three marks of exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>It belonged, that little inscription, to the good old
days of the reign of King Edward, when girls wore
sailor hats in the country, and shirts with stiff collars
and ties, when every one, or so it seemed to Lady Cust,
was normal and simple and comfortable, and had the
same ambitions, namely, to hit hard at tennis, and to
ride straight to hounds.</p>

<p>“Were you at Ascot this year?” “Have you been
much to the Opera this season?” “What do you
think of the mallet for this year? Seems to <i>me</i> it
would take a crane to lift it!”</p>

<p>Such, in those days, had been the sensible conversational
openings; while, recently, the man who had
taken her into dinner had begun by asking her the name
of her butcher; another by asking her if she liked
string. Mad! Quite mad!</p>

<p>Of course, there were cultured people in those days
too, but they were just as easy to talk to as the others.
“Do you sing Guy d’Hardelot’s ‘I know a Lovely
Garden?’ There’s really <i>nothing</i> to touch his songs.”
“Have you been to the Academy yet? And oh, <i>did</i>
you see that picture next to Sargeant’s portrait of
Lady ——? It’s of Androcles taking a thorn out of
<i>such</i> a jolly lion’s paw.” “Oh yes, of course, that’s
from dear old Omar, isn’t it? There’s no one like him,
is there? You know, I like the Rubaiyat really
better than Tennyson.”</p>

<p>And now—there were strikes, and nearly all their
neighbours had either let or sold their places; and Guy
had the most idiotic ideas and the most extraordinary
friends; and Francis....</p>

<p>The Doña’s eyes rested for a moment on the photographs;
she was too short-sighted to be able to distinguish
any details; but she could see that they were
of a young man, and guessed that he was the son who
had been killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“It’s much better for <i>her</i>,” she thought bitterly, “she
hasn’t the fear for his soul to keep her awake.”</p>

<p>Lady Cust saw that she had noticed the photographs,
and a dozen invisible spears flew out to guard her grief.
Then she remembered having heard that the Doña had
lost a daughter: “But that’s not the same as one’s
eldest son—besides, she has grandchildren.”</p>

<p>Aloud she said, “One good thing about having no
daughter, I always feel, is that one is saved having a
wedding in the house. It must mean such endless
organising and worry, and what with servants being so
difficult nowadays.... But this is such a perfect
house for a wedding—so gay! We are so shut in with
trees. Dear old Rory, I’m so fond of him; he’s my only
nephew, and ... er ... Concha is such a pretty
thing.”</p>

<p>It was clear that at this point the Doña was expected
to praise Rory; but she merely gave a vague, courteous
smile.</p>

<p>“I have heard so much about you all from my Guy,”
continued Lady Cust; “he is so devoted to you all, and
you have been <i>so</i> good to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we are all very fond of Guy,” said the Doña
stiffly.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very nice of you to say so—he’s a dear
old thing,” she paused, “and your other daughter,
Teresa, she’s tremendously clever, isn’t she? I should
so love to get to know her, but I’m afraid she’d despise
me—I’m <i>such</i> a fool!” and she gave her rippling laugh.</p>

<p>The Doña, again, only smiled conventionally.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all ...” and Lady Cust gave a little
sigh. “You see, Rory was my only sister’s only child,
and she died when he was seven, so he has been almost
like my own son. I wonder ... don’t you think it’s
... it’s a little sudden?”</p>

<p>“What is?” asked the Doña icily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“Well, they haven’t known each other very long, have
they? I don’t know ... marriage ... is so ...”</p>

<p>So this foolish, giggling, pink and white woman was
not pleased about the marriage! She probably thought
Concha was not good enough for her nephew.</p>

<p>And the Doña who, for the last few days, had been
half hoping that the Immaculate Conception herself,
star-crowned, blue-robed, would to-morrow step down
from the clouds to forbid the banns and save her namesake
from perdition—the Doña actually found herself
saying with some heat: “They’ve known each other
for nearly a year; that is surely a long time, these
days. I see no reason why it shouldn’t be a most happy
marriage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m <i>sure</i> ... you know ... one always ...”
murmured Lady Cust.</p>

<p>“Well, I must leave you to your rest. You have
everything that you want?” and the Doña sailed out
of the room.</p>

<p>Lady Cust smiled a little, and then sighed.</p>

<p>Dear old Rory! And what would Mab, her dead
sister, think of it all? Oh, why had it not been she
that had died in those old, happy days?</p>

<p>She went to her dressing-table and took up the folding
leather frame. They were the photographs of a very
beautiful young man, a true Brabazon—a longer limbed,
merrier eyed Rory, with a full, rather insolent mouth.</p>

<p>Yes, it was funny—she had been apt to call him by
the names of her dead brothers: “Jack! Geoffrey!
Desmond! <i>Francis</i>, I mean.” She had never had any
difficulty in understanding Francis—how they used to
laugh together!</p>

<p>She remembered how she used to dread his marriage;
jealously watching him with his favourite partners at
tennis and at dances, and suspiciously scanning the
photographs of unknown and improperly pretty young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
ladies in his bedroom: <i>Best of luck! Rosie; Ever your
chum, Vera</i>—sick at the thought of perhaps having to
welcome a musical-comedy actress as Francis’s wife.</p>

<p>If only she had known! For now, were she suddenly
to wake up and find it was for Francis’s wedding that
she was here—the bride Concha Lane, or that extraordinary
Miss Penn, or, even, “Rosie” or “Vera,” her
heart would burst, she would go mad with happiness.</p>

<p>And she had a friend who actually dared to be heartbroken
because she had suddenly got a letter from her
only son, telling her that he had been married at a
registry to a war-widow, whom she knew to be a tenth-rate
little minx with bobbed hair and the mind of a
barmaid.</p>

<p>But Francis ... she would never be at his wedding.
She would never hear his voice again—Francis was
dead.</p>

<p class="tb">When, an hour later, Sir Roger looked in on his way
to dress, he found her lying on the sofa, reading the
<i>Sketch</i>, smiling and serene.</p>

<p>“Well, May,” he said, “I saw you! You were on
the point of disgracing yourself just before you went
upstairs. <i>Extraordinary</i> thing! Will you never get
over this trick of giggling? You simply have no self-control,
darling.”</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i>, isn’t it dreadful? Well, what do you think
of ’em all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they seem all right. Rory’s girl’s extraordinary
pretty—pretty manners, too.”</p>

<p>“Charming! ‘I should lo-o-ove to,’” and she
reproduced admirably Concha’s company voice. “However,”
she went on, “we have a great deal to be thankful
for—it might have been Miss Penn. ‘Don’t you
ado-o-ore albinos?’ Oh, I shall <i>never</i> forget it ...
and Major Arbuthnot’s face! Still, if it had been she,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
I must say I should have loved to see the sensation
produced on Edinburgh by old Jimmy’s walking down
Princes Street with her.”</p>

<p>Sir Roger gave a hoarse chuckle.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>As it was too large a party to get comfortably into
the dining-room, a big tent had been pitched on the
lawn, and several long narrow tables joined together,
and there they dined, an ill-assorted company.</p>

<p>At one end Dr. Sinclair was shouting to Lady Cust,
“Well, I’d send him to that co-education place, but,
unfortunately, they don’t ... er ... <span class="smcap">learn</span> anything
there. They make the fourth form read Tolstoy’s
<i>Resurrection</i>, which is not ... er ... only the most
... er ... <span class="smcap">trashy</span> of all the works of genius, but the
only ... er ... <i>lesson</i> to be learned from it is the
... er ... inadvisability of ... er ... <span class="smcap">seducing
a Russian peasant girl</span>, and ... er ... unfortunately,
an ... er ... er ... English schoolboy hasn’t
many opportunities of doing that ... er ... er....”</p>

<p>He looked at her, slightly puzzled—her face was pink
with suppressed laughter; but, as she was meant to
laugh, why suppress it?</p>

<p>Elfrida Penn was terrifying “Crippin” Arbuthnot
by searching questions as to whether the erotic adventures
of his schooldays had been similar to those
described in a recent novel about life at a public
school.</p>

<p>Edward Lane was saying to Jollypot, “Yes, before
my niece—Olive Jackson, you know—went to school,
I said to her, ‘my advice to you is: <i>keep your hands
clean</i>.’ I always....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Lane, that was beautiful!” cried Jollypot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I always say a lady can be known by the way
she keeps her <i>hands</i>.”</p>

<p>Jollypot’s face fell.</p>

<p>But Dick and Hugh, at any rate, yelling at each other
across the intervening forms of Concha and Rory, were
in perfect harmony. “I say, Dick, do you remember
old Bright, the butler at your father’s? And how angry
he used to be when we asked him if he was any relation
of John Bright?”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather; and do you remember how he used
to say, ‘Port, claret, sherry, madeira, sir?’ always in
that order.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and how he used to puff it down one’s neck?
And the severe way your mother used to say, ‘Neither,
thank you, Bright’!”</p>

<p>Then, from the other end, they would catch sight of
the Doña glaring at them indignantly through her
<i>lorgnette</i>, and Dick would turn hurriedly to Lady
Cust.</p>

<p>As to Teresa, she was indulging in that form of
intoxication that has been described before—that of
æsthetically withdrawing herself from a large, chattering
company. Once when she was doing it David had
guessed, and had whispered to her, “The laird’s been
deed these twa hoors, but I wisna for spoiling guid
company,” in reference to a host who had inconspicuously
died, sitting bolt upright at the head of his table, at
about the third round of port.</p>

<p>A branch, or something, outside was casting a shadow
on the tent’s canvas wall—as usual, it was in the form
of Dante’s profile. She had seen it in patches of damp
on ceilings, in burning coals, in the clouds, in shadows
cast on the white walls of the bath-room.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had not really looked like that at all,
and the famous fresco portrait had been originally
merely a patch of damp, elaborated into the outline of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
a human profile by some wag of the fourteenth century,
and called Dante; and perhaps the Dante he meant
was not the poet at all, but some popular buffoon,
Pantaloon or Harlequin, in the comedies at street
corners—the Charlie Chaplin, in fact, of his age....</p>

<p>But for some time Colonel Dundas had been booming
away in her right ear, and it was high time she should
listen.</p>

<p>“... <i>always a note-book on the links, and every shot
recorded</i>—it’s a golden rule. I’ve advised more than
one Amateur Champion to follow it. You see my point,
don’t you? The next time you play on the same links
you whip out your note-book and say, ‘Let me see—<i>Muirfield,
sixth hole, Sept. 5, 1920</i>: hit apparently good
drive down centre of the course, found almost impossible
approach shot owing to cross bunkers. <i>N.B.
Keep to the left at the sixth hole.</i>’ You see my point,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>Opposite to them, Guy was screaming excitedly to
Elfrida Penn, who seemed to be sucking in his words
through her thick lips: “Of course, there’s <i>nothing</i> so
beautiful and significant, from the point of view of
composition, as a lot of people sitting at a narrow table—it’s
the making of the Christian religion. Aubrey
Beardsley ought to have done a <i>Cena</i>: the Apostles,
in curly white wigs like these little tight clustering roses—Dorothy
Perkins, or whatever they’re called—and
black masks, sitting down one side of a narrow refectory
table with plates piled up with round fruits, the wall
behind them fluted and garlanded in stucco, St. John,
his periwigged head on Jesus’ shoulder, leering up at
him, and Judas, sitting a little apart, a white Pierrot,
one finger pressed against his button mouth, his eyes
round with horror and glee....”</p>

<p>“Yes, every year I was in India I read it through,
from <i>cover to cover</i>,” boomed Colonel Dundas proudly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
(Oh yes, of course, Dobbin and the <i>History of the Punjab</i>!)
“It’s a wonderful style. He comes next to Shakespeare,
in my estimation.” (Not Dobbin and the <i>History of the
Punjab</i>, then!) “Yes, every year I read the whole of
the <i>French Revolution</i> through from cover to cover—a
very great book. And when, by mistake, John Stuart
Mill burned the manuscript, what do you think Carlyle
did?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What did he do?”</p>

<p>“He sat down and read through all the works of
Fenimore Cooper—read ’em through from <i>beginning
to end</i>,” and he stared at her in solemn triumph.</p>

<p>“Really?” she gasped, “I don’t quite understand.
Fenimore Cooper—he wrote about Red Indians, didn’t
he? Why did he read <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i>Why?</i> To distract his mind, of course. Extraordinary
pluck!” and he glared at her angrily.</p>

<p>At this point Sir Roger, who had not been making
much way with the Doña, leaned across the table, and
said, “I say, Jimmy, Mrs. Lane and I have been talking
about Gib.—did I ever tell you about the time I dined
with your old Mess there? Owing to my being a connection
of yours the Colonel asked me to choose a tune
for the pipes;” then, turning to the Doña, he said in
parenthesis, “I don’t know whether you’ve ever heard
the bagpipes, but—don’t tell Colonel Dundas—we don’t
think much of ’em this side of the border.” Then
again to Colonel Dundas, “Well, for the life of me, I
couldn’t remember the name of a tune, and then suddenly
the <i>Deil amang the Tailors</i> came into my head, so out
I came with it, as pleased as Punch. Well, I thought
the Colonel looked a bit grim, and I saw ’em all looking
at each other, but the order was given to the piper, and
he got going, and, by gad, it <i>was</i> a tune—nearly took the
roof off the place! I thought I should be deaf for life—turned
out to be the loudest tune they’d got;” then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
again to the extremely bored Doña, “but it’s a glorious
place, old Gib. I remember in the eighties....”</p>

<p>Lady Cust, watching from the other end of the table,
was much amused by the <i>engouement</i> her husband had
developed, since arriving at Plasencia, for the society
of Jimmy Dundas; it was clearly a case of “better the
bore I know....”</p>

<p>“Yes, these were great days,” Colonel Dundas was
saying; “we’re the oldest regiment of the line, you
know—Pontius Pilate’s Bodyguard; that’s what we
call ourselves—Pontius Pilate’s Bodyguard!” and he
chuckled proudly.</p>

<p>And this from a pillar of the Scottish Episcopal
Church!... Oh pale Galilean, <i>hast</i> thou conquered?</p>

<p class="tb">Then a loving-cup filled with punch began to go the
round and they all drank from it in turn, rising to their
feet as they did so, and saying, “Concha! Rory!”</p>

<p>When every one had had a sip, Rory, rather pale,
got up to return thanks.</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen!... (pause) ... I do
think it’s <i>extraordinary</i> kind of you to drink our health
in this very nice way. We are most awfully grateful ...
(pause) ... I’m afraid I’m not a Cicero or a Lloyd
George, or anything like that ... (Laughter) ... old
Crippin there will tell you speeches ain’t much in my
line....” Then he had a sudden brilliant idea:
“But there’s one thing I should like to ask you all to
do. You see, I’m awfully grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lane
for giving me Concha, and my uncle has always been
most awfully good to me, and I’d like to ask you all to
drink their health ... and if my mother is anywhere
about ... and others ... I know they’ll join in the
toast, in nectar, or whatever they drink up there,” and
he ended with an apologetic little laugh.</p>

<p>The company was very much touched; Edward Lane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
blew his nose violently, and muttered to Jollypot that
young Dundas was evidently a very nice-feeling young
fellow.</p>

<p>The atmosphere having become emotional, the ghosts
walked.</p>

<p>Colonel Dundas had a vision of Rory’s mother—lovely
Mab Brabazon—as he had first seen her, radiant
and laughing at the Northern Meeting of twenty-nine
years ago; but then, ever since, he had so often had
that vision: at Church Parade, at polo in India, playing
golf in Scotland, playing Bridge in any of his ten clubs—anywhere,
everywhere, he might see Mab Brabazon.
And little had Teresa guessed that as Carlyle read
Fenimore Cooper, so <i>he</i> had read the <i>French Revolution</i>—“to
distract his mind.”</p>

<p>Sir Roger and Lady Cust thought of Francis; more
than one of Pepa. But Dick thought of his sallow
puritanic sister Joannah, who had been so much older
than himself that their interests had never clashed, and
all his memories of her were of petting and spoiling—“Little
Dickie doesn’t <i>take</i> spoiling, his temper is so
sweet,” she used to say—his eyes began to smart. And
Hugh Mallam, too, thought of poor old Joannah Lane,
and he remembered how, in the days when his ambition
had been to be a painter, he used to wonder whether, if
offered the certainty of becoming as great a one as Sir
Frederick Leighton, on condition of marrying Joannah,
he would be able to bring himself to do it.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>After dinner they went into the garden; some of them
sitting on the lawn, some of them wandering about
among the flowers.</p>

<p>The border was in the summer prime of lilies and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
peonies and anchusa and delphiniums; to its right was
a great clump of lavender nearly ripe, and at the stage
when it looks like veins of porphyry running through a
rock of jade; a little to its left was a stiff row of hollyhocks.</p>

<p>“An amazingly distinguished flower, hollyhock!”
said Guy, “it always gives a <i>cachet</i> to its surroundings,
so different from sweetpeas, which look sordid in a dusty
station garden, and fragrantly <i>bourgeois</i> beside the
suburban lawn on which Miss Smith is playing tennis
in lavender muslin....”</p>

<p>“<i>Guy!</i>” cried Lady Cust, looking round anxiously
at the company, and laughing apologetically; Guy,
however, went on undaunted; “but hollyhock is like
the signature of a great painter, it testifies that any
subject can be turned into art—or, rather, into that
domain which lies between painting and poetry, where
damoizelles, dressed in quaintly damasked brocades,
talk of friendship and death and the stars in curious
stiff conceits.”</p>

<p>“Guy! You <i>are</i> a duffer,” laughed Lady Cust again.</p>

<p>“Well, here come some of these damoizelles in their
quaint brocades—do you think they are talking about
friendship and death and the stars?</p>

<p>“Do you think they are talking about friendship
and death and the stars? Do you think they are
talking about friendship and death and the stars?”
said Hugh Mallam with his jolly laugh, and he
nodded towards Concha and Elfrida Penn and Lettice
Moore and Winifred Norton, who, dressed in a variety
of pale colours, were walking arm in arm up the
border.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve in a fine passage describes the moment
in a journey south when “en descendant le fleuve, on a
passé une de ces lignes par delà lesquelles le soleil et le
ciel sont plus beaux.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Such a line—beyond which “the sun and the sky are
more beautiful”—cuts across the range of every one’s
vision; and the group of flower-bordered girls were
certainly beyond that line for all who were watching
them. Once again Teresa felt as if she were suddenly
seeing the present as the past; and as long as she lived
it would always be as that picture that she would see
Concha’s wedding.</p>

<p>“<i>Vera incessu patuit dea</i>,” murmured Hugh, and
then he added, a little wistfully, “they <i>do</i> look jolly!”</p>

<p>“You’d look just as jolly far off, in that light, Hugh,”
said Dick, who was sitting blinking at his flowers, like
a large, contented tom-cat.</p>

<p>The younger men who, with the exception of Guy,
had been walking up and down between the hawthorn
hedge, smoking cigars and deep in talk—probably about
the War—went and joined the four girls; and after a
few moments of general chatter Arnold flung his arm
round Concha’s shoulder and Teresa could hear him
saying: “Come on, Conch,” and they wandered off
by themselves. She was glad; for she knew that
Concha had felt acutely the estrangement from Arnold
caused by his jealousy at her engagement.</p>

<p>Then Rory came and joined the party on the lawn,
and sat down on the grass at the feet of Lady Cust.</p>

<p>“Well, what about a little Bridge?” said Dick, and
he, Hugh, Sir Roger, and Colonel Dundas, went indoors
for a rubber.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Lady Cust and Rory wandered off
together in the direction of the lavender.</p>

<p>“Well, Rorrocks, so you’re really going to do
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt May, I’m in for it this time ... the
great adventure!” and he laughed a little nervously,
“Concha ... she ... don’t you think she’s
pretty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>“Awfully pretty, Rory, I do really ... a dear
thing!”</p>

<p>They felt that there were many things they wanted
to say to each other, these two; but, apart from reserve
and false shame, they would have found it hard to
express these things in words.</p>

<p>“Well, time does fly! It seems just the other day
that I was scurrying up to Edinburgh for your christening
... and Fran ... Guy was only a year old.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ... I can hardly believe it myself,” and
again he gave a little nervous laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, dear old thing,” and she laid a hand on his
arm, “I’m your godmother, you know, and your mother
and I ... I don’t believe we were ever away from
each other till I married ... you’re sure ... it’s
going to be all right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt May, it’s going to be all right.... I’m
sure,” and again he laughed; and although he was very
pale, his eyes were bright and happy.</p>

<p class="tb">“Shall we go and walk down the border and look
beautiful too?” said Guy to Teresa.</p>

<p>“Well, and what about the play?” he asked, when
they were out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>“It’s finished at last ... so I can breathe again.
While I was writing I felt rather like a sort of Thomas
the Rhymer, a thrall to ghosts and fairies; and I got
half to hate the whole thing, as one is always inclined
to hate a master.”</p>

<p>She was trying to be friendly, and thought it would
please him if she told him about such intimate things;
but he was not pleased.</p>

<p>Though he had never written anything long enough
to give him at first hand the feeling she had described,
yet he realised it was what certainly <i>would</i> be felt by a
genuine dramatist or novelist; and it was not in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
picture that Teresa should be either—Sophocles may
have led his own choruses, but he did not lead those of
Euripides.</p>

<p>“The play’s finished, and yet all this,” and she waved
her arm vaguely in the direction of the house and garden
and all the groups of people, “and yet all this goes on
just the same.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Next day came the queer dislocated morning—every
one either at a loose end or frantically busy,—the arrival
of Dr. Nigel Dundas, Bishop of Dunfermline, Colonel
Dundas’s first cousin, who had travelled all night from
Scotland, to be there to marry Rory; the hurried cold
luncheon; the getting the Custs and people off to the
church; then Parker’s and Teresa’s fingers fumbling
with hooks and eyes and arranging the veil.</p>

<p>When the bride was dressed, and ready to go downstairs,
the Doña, who had not appeared all morning,
and was not, of course, going to the church ceremony,
walked into the room, pale and heavy-eyed.</p>

<p>She held out her arms, “Come to me, my Concha!”
she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doña ... if only ... I couldn’t ... it’ll be
all right,” Concha whispered between little sobs, “and
anyway, your baby will always love you ... and ...”</p>

<p>“The Purissima and all the Saints bless you, my
child,” said the Doña in a stifled voice, and she made the
sign of the Cross on her forehead, “but you mustn’t cry
on your wedding day. Come, let me put your veil
straight.”</p>

<p>Teresa, watching this little scene, felt a sudden pang
of remorse—why had she not more control over her
imagination? Why had she allowed her mother to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
turn, in the play, into such a sinister and shameless
figure?</p>

<p>Then they went down to the hall, where Dick was
contemplating in a pier-glass, with considerable complacency,
the reflection of his stout morning-coated
person.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite time we were starting, Concha,”
he called out; and with that amazing ignoring of the
emotional conventions by which men are continually
hurting the feelings of women, it was not till he and
Concha were well on their way to church, that he
remembered to congratulate her on her appearance.</p>

<p>Teresa, Jollypot, and the children, had gone on ahead
in the open car—past hens, past hedges, past motor-bicycles,
past cottage gardens; past fields of light
feathery oats, so thickly sown with poppies that
they seemed to flicker together into one fabric;
past fields of barley that had swallowed the wind,
which bent and ruffled the ductile imprisoning substance
that it informed; past fields of half-ripe
wheat, around the stalks of which Teresa, who, since
she had been writing, had fallen into an almost exhausting
habit of automatic observation, noticed the
light tightly twisting itself in strands of greenish
lavender. And there was a field from which the hay
had been carried long enough to have allowed a fresh
crop of poppies to spring up; to see them thus alone and
unhampered gave one such a stab of joyous relief that
one could almost believe the hay to have been but a
parasite scum drained away to reveal this red substratum
of beauty. All these things, as they rushed
past, were remarked by Teresa’s weary, active eyes
till they had reached the church and deposited Anna
and Jasper with the bridesmaids, waiting in the
porch, and at last they were walking up the aisle
and being ushered into their places by Bob Norton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>There stood Major Arbuthnot, whispering and giggling
with Rory, who was looking very white and bright-eyed.
After all, he was not lower than the birds—he, too, felt
the thrill of mating-time.</p>

<p>Then the opening bars of the <i>Voice that Breathed
o’er Eden</i>, and a stiffening to attention of Major
Arbuthnot, and a sudden smile from Rory, and all eyes
turning to the door—Concha was entering on her
father’s arm, her train held up by Jasper.</p>

<p>Then the Oxford voice of Dr. Nigel Dundas, droning
on, droning on, till it reached the low antiphon with
Rory:</p>

<p>Then Concha’s turn and then more prayers; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
before long they were all laughing and chattering and
wiping away tears in the vestry; while in the church
the band was playing shamelessly secular tunes,
though Mr. Moore had stipulated that there should be
“no vaudeville music.”</p>

<p>“<i>Why</i> are people crying? A wedding isn’t a <i>sad</i>
thing,” said Anna, in a loud and argumentative voice.</p>

<p class="tb">Then down the aisle and down the path between a
double hedge of Girl Guides, and whirling back to the
Plasencia garden and masses and masses of people.</p>

<p>Teresa was immediately sucked into a vortex of
activities—elbowing her way through the crowd with a
cup of tea for one old lady and an ice for another;
steering a third to one of the tents, to choose for herself
what she wanted; making suitable rejoinders to such
questions and exclamations as: “How charming dear
Concha looks, I really think she’s the prettiest bride I’ve
ever seen.” “Do tell me what the red ribbon is that
Captain Dundas is wearing—the one that isn’t the M.C.?
Some one said they thought it was a Belgian order.”
“Tell me dear; it was the Scottish Church Service,
wasn’t it? I mean, the Scotch Church that’s like <i>ours</i>?
I did so like it ... so much more ... well, <i>delicate</i>
than ours.” “Oh, just look at those masses of white
butterflies on the lavender! What a splendid crop
you’ll have! Do you send it up to London?”</p>

<p>Then, as in a nightmare, she heard Anna proclaiming
proudly that she had eaten eight ices, and Jasper ten;
well, it was too late now to take any measures.</p>

<p>Also, she had time to be amused at noticing that Mrs.
Moore had managed to get introduced to Lady Cust,
and was talking to her eagerly.</p>

<p>Later on she heard Lettice Moore saying to another
bridesmaid, “Poor old Eben! He was frightfully cut
up when he heard about the engagement,” and, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
foolish way one has of moving indifferently among the
world’s great tragedies—earthquakes, famines, wars—and
suddenly feeling a tightening of the throat, and a
smarting of the eyes as one realises that at that moment
a bullfinch is probably dying in China, Teresa suddenly
felt a wave of pity and tenderness sweep over her for
Eben, sitting in his cabin (did senior “snotties” have a
cabin to themselves? Well, it didn’t really matter),
so poorly furnished in comparison with the gramophones
and silver photograph frames, and gorgeous cushions
of his mates, his arms, with the red hands whose fingers
had never recovered their shape from the chilblains of
the Baltic, dangling limply down at either side of him,
and perhaps tears in his round china-blue eyes.</p>

<p>Then at last Concha and Rory were running and
ducking and laughing under a shower of rice, and rose
leaves. They looked very young and frail, both of them,
blown out into the world, where God knew what awaited
them.</p>

<p>“They are like Paulo and Francesca—two leaves
clinging together, blown by the wind,” said Jollypot
dreamily to Teresa.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>We have already likened a wedding to a fall of snow;
and as rapidly as a fall of snow it melts, disclosing
underneath it just such a dingy world.</p>

<p>One by one the motley company drifted off in trains,
and motors, their exit producing on Teresa the same
impression that she always got from the end of <i>Twelfth
Night</i>—that of a troupe of fairy mimes, laden with
their tiffany, their pasteboard yew hedges, their stucco
peacocks, slowly sailing away in a cloud out of sight,
while the clown whom they have forgotten, sits down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
here on the earth singing <i>the rain it raineth every
day</i>.</p>

<p>But, in spite of a dismantled drawing-room, a billiard-table
covered with presents, a trampled lawn and a
furious Parker and Rudge, life quickly re-adjusted itself.</p>

<p>The next day but one there was a rose show in
the county town, and Rudge went to see it.</p>

<p>After dinner, Dick had him summoned to the drawing-room
to discuss the roses with himself and the Doña.</p>

<p>His leathery cheeks were flushed, his hard eyes shone:
“Oh ... it was grand, ma’am. I was saying to Mrs.
Rudge, ‘Well, I said, one doesn’t often see a sight like
that!’ I said. There was a new white rose, sir, well,
I’ve never seen anything to beat it....”</p>

<p>“And what about the <i>Daily Clarion</i> rose?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, a very fine rose, certainly, but I’m not
sure if it would do with us ... but that white rose,
sir, I said to Mrs. Rudge, ‘you could almost say it was
like the moon,’ I said.”</p>

<p class="tb">And what was Time but a gigantic rose, shedding,
one by one, its petals? And then Jollypot gathered
them up and made them into <i>pot-pourri</i>; but still the
petals went on falling, silently, ceaselessly.</p>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>That year there was a marvellous harvest, and by
the end of July the sun had burned the wheat into the
very quintessence of gold, and every evening for a few
moments the reflection of its dying rays transfigured
it into a vision, so glorious, so radiant, that
Dick, looking up from his fish, would exclaim
to the dinner-table, “Good God! Look at the
wheat!”</p>

<p>Thus must the memory of the corn of Cana, sown
with symbols, heavy with memories and legends,
radiant with gleams caught from the Golden City in
the skies, have appeared to St. John dying in the
desert.</p>

<p>Teresa, having, during her walks in the view, noticed
a field of wheat from which a segment had already
been cut, so that, with the foil of the flat earth beside
it, she was able to see the whole depth of the crop,
carried away an impression of the greater thickness
of wheat-fields as compared to those containing the
other crops; and this impression—strengthened by
the stronger colouring of the wheat, for to the memory
quality is often indistinguishable from quantity—lingering
with her after she had got back to Plasencia,
whence the view always appeared <i>pintado</i>, a picture,
gave her the delusion of appreciating the actual <i>paint</i>,
not merely as a medium of representation, but as a
beautiful substance in itself; as one appreciates it in
a Monet or a Monticelli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>And all the time, silently, imperceptibly, like the
processes of nature, the work of harvest was transforming
the picture, till by the end of the first week
in August many of the planes of unbroken colour
had been dotted into shocks or garnered into ricks.
The only visible agent of this transformation was an
occasional desultory wain with a green tarpaulin tilt,
meandering through the silent fields. Its progress
through, and its relation to, or, rather, its lack of
relation to, the motionless view gave Teresa an almost
eerie sense of incongruity, and made her think of a
vase of crimson roses she had sat gazing at one night
in the drawing-room. The light of the lamp behind
it had changed the substance of the roses into something
so translucent that they seemed to be made of
a fluid or of light. A tiny insect was creeping in and
out among their petals, and as she watched it she
had a sense of being mentally out of gear in that she
could see simultaneously phenomena belonging to such
different planes of consciousness as these static phantom
flames and that restless creature of the earth—they
themselves, at any rate, could neither feel or see each
other.</p>

<p>Then they all went away—the Doña and Dick to
join Hugh Mallam at Harlech, Jollypot to a sister in
Devonshire, and Teresa to Cambridge to stay with
Harry Sinclair.</p>

<p>The year began to pay the penalty of its magnificence;
for “violent fires soon burn out themselves”; and
Teresa, walking down the Backs, or punting up to
Byron’s pool, or bicycling among the lovely Cambridgeshire
villages, saw everywhere signs of the
approach of autumn in reddening leaves and reddening
fruits, and there kept running in her head lines from a
poem of Herrick’s on <i>Lovers How They Come and
Part</i>.</p>

<p>While she was there she met Haines (the man who
ran the pastoral players). He had heard of her play
from Guy, and was so importunate in his requests to
be allowed to read it that she finally gave it to him.</p>

<p>Guy had been right—the need to publish or produce
was biological: useless to fight against.</p>

<p>Haines liked it, and wanted to set his company working
at it at once.</p>

<p>As one hypnotised, she agreed to all of his suggestions:
“Cust says you have a lawn with a view which would
make an excellent natural background ... I believe
it would be the very thing. It’s a piece that needs very
few properties—some cardboard trees for the orchard,
a few bottles and phials for Trotaconventos’s house, and
an altar to give the effect of a chapel in the last scene
... yes, it should be very nice on your lawn, I think
folk will like it.”</p>

<p>Did he say <i>folk</i>? But, of course, it would obviously
be a favourite word of his.</p>

<p class="tb">So, <i>Folk</i> were to take a hand—<i>Folk</i> were to spring
up like mushrooms on the lawn of Plasencia, and embody
her dreams!</p>

<p>A little shiver went down her spine.</p>

<p>“I am a fool, I am a fool, I am a fool,” she muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>They all came back to Plasencia at the beginning of
September.</p>

<p>The Doña received the plan of the play’s being acted
on her lawn with indulgent indifference; ever since
they had been quite little her children had periodically
organised dramatic performances. “Mrs. Moore can
bring her Women’s Institute to watch it, and that should
leave me in peace for this year, at any rate. I suppose
we’d better have the county too, though we <i>did</i> give
them cakes and ices enough at Concha’s wedding to
last them their lifetime. What is this play of yours
about, Teresa?”</p>

<p>“Oh ... old Seville,” she answered nervously, “a
nunnery ... and ... and ... there’s a knight ...
and there’s an old sort of ... sort of witch.”</p>

<p>“Aha! an old gipsy. And does she give the girls
love potions?” And the Doña, her head a little on
one side, contemplated her, idly quizzical.</p>

<p>“Yes, I daresay she does,” and Teresa gave a nervous
laugh, “it’s an <i>auto sacramentál</i>,” she added.</p>

<p>The Doña looked interested: “An <i>auto sacramentál</i>?
That’s what they used to play in the old days in the
Seville streets at Corpus Christi. Your great-grandmother
de La Torre saw one of the last they ever did,”
then she began to chuckle, “an <i>auto sacramentál</i> on an
English lawn! Poor Mrs. Moore and her Women’s
Institute! Still, it will be very good for them, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p class="tb">Would she guess? She was horribly intelligent; but
not literary, so there was hope—and yet ... that
affective sensitiveness that, having taken the place for
centuries of education and intellection, has developed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
in the women of Spain into what is almost a sixth
sense....</p>

<p>Well, if she did guess it would be only what she knew
already, and if she chose to draw false conclusions—let
her!</p>

<p>But would she recognise herself? The mere possibility
of this made Teresa blush crimson. But it was
not her fault; she had not meant to draw her like that—it
had grown on her hands.</p>

<p>And then she thought no more about it, but wandered
through the garden and ripening orchard, muttering
absently:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So silently they one to th’other come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As colours steale into the Pear or Plum.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>After what seemed an interminable correspondence
with Haines, it was settled that he should bring his
company to act the play at the end of September.
Teresa had tried hard to make the date an earlier or a
later one; but it was not to be ... and perhaps ...
who could tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore was delighted that her Institute was to
see a play about old Spain, and was sure that it would
be most educative.</p>

<p>The idea of its being played before Mrs. Moore
and a Women’s Institute amused Teresa; after all
it was none of her doing, and she liked watching life
when it was left free to arrange its own humorous
combinations.</p>

<p>Concha and Rory, Arnold, Harry Sinclair, and Guy,
all came to stay at Plasencia to see it; and two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
days before the performance a telegram came from
David, asking if they could put him up for a few
nights.</p>

<p>The Doña frowned as she read it, and Guy looked at
Teresa; but Concha and Rory begged that room might
be made for him, “It will be his last beano, poor
creature,” they said.</p>

<p>Well, if it was to be, it was to be. Once one ceases
to strain against the chain of events, the peace of
numbness creeps over one’s weary limbs, and anyway
... perhaps....</p>

<p class="tb">The day of the performance arrived; it was to begin
at two o’clock.</p>

<p>All morning Teresa was busy with preparations; she
could not help being amused by the tremendous importance
that everything concerning it had for Haines—it
was like Parker, who seemed to think the world should
stop moving during the fitting-on in the sewing-room of
a new blouse.</p>

<p>No one had time to go in the car to meet David; and
they had already begun luncheon when he arrived. All
the actors were there, so it was a large party, and he sat
down on the Doña’s left hand, far away from Teresa.
She noticed that he ate practically nothing. He looked
much stronger than in the spring, and his expression
was almost buoyant.</p>

<p>Before the audience arrived, and when the actors
were dressing in the two tents pitched on the lawn, they
got a few words together.</p>

<p>“I’ve come,” he said, smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes ... you’ve come,” she answered.</p>

<p>“So you’ve been writing a play—‘a chiel amang us
takin’ notes’!” and he smiled down on her.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Moore came bustling across the lawn,
shepherding her Institute, a score of working women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
in their Sunday finery, many of them carrying
babies.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Teresa, what a glorious day! I
saw dear Concha in church on Sunday; looking so
bonny. It must be delightful having her back again.
Well, this is a great surprise; we didn’t know you were
an author; did we, Mrs. Bolton? We didn’t know Miss
Lane wrote; did we? Well, we’re all very much looking
forward to it; aren’t we, Mrs. Hedges? I don’t expect
you’ve seen many plays before.”</p>

<p>“I saw <i>East Lynne</i> when I was in service in Bedford,”
said one woman proudly.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen that on the pictures,” said another.</p>

<p>Then the “gentry” began to arrive: “<i>What</i> a day
for your play!” “Oh, what a <i>sight</i> your Michaelmas
daisies are! It really is a perfect setting for a pastoral
play,” “Are there to be any country dances?” “Ah!
<i>you</i> have that single rose too ... it certainly is very
decorative, but I thought Mr. Lane said ... ah!
there he is, in flannels, wise man!” “Ah, there’s
Mistress Concha, looking about sixteen, dear thing!—”
“I do think it’s a splendid idea having the Institute
women—it’s so good for them, this sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>Then fantastic figures began to dart in and out of the
two tents: a knight in pasteboard armour, a red cross
painted on his shield, a friar with glimpses of scarlet
hose under his habit—all of them “holy people of God,”
all of them dead hundreds of years ago ... <i>Folk</i>,
unmistakably <i>Folk</i>.</p>

<p>Soon the audience was seated; the chattering ceased,
and the play began.</p>

<p>This was the play:</p>

<h4>ACT I</h4>

<h5>SCENE I</h5>

<div class="scene">

<p><i>The court of the Convent of San Miguel: its floor
is diapered with brightly-coloured tiles; in its centre
is a fountain, round which are set painted pots of
sweet basil, myrtle, etc., its walls are decorated with
arabesques and mottoes in Arabic characters; against
one wall is a little shrine containing a wooden virgin.
<span class="smcap">Sister Assumcion</span> is reading aloud from “Amadis
de Gaul” to four nuns who are sitting round on rugs
embroidering. A Moorish slave is keeping the flies
from them with a large fan.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>reads</i>): The hand then drew her
in, and she was as joyful as though the whole world
had been given her, not so much for the prize of
beauty, which had been won, as that she had thus
proved herself the worthy mate of Amadis, having, like
him, entered the forbidden chamber, and deprived all
others of the hope of that glory.</p>

<p>(<i>Lays down the book</i>): Well, and so that is the end of
the fair Lady Oriana.</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i> (<i>with a giggle</i>): Has any one yet put this
reading of Amadis into their confession?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: More fool they then if they have;
we may confess it now that we have reached the
colophon. Better absolution for a sheep than a lamb.
(<i>They laugh</i>).</p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: Ah, well, ’tis but a venial sin, and when
one thinks....</p>

<p><i>Third Nun</i>: Ay, praise be to heaven for the humours
that swell old abbesses’ legs and make them keep a-bed!</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: Truly, since she took to her bed, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
have been fine doings in this house—it was but yesterday
that we were reckoning that it must be close on five
months since the Prioress has kept frater.</p>

<p><i>Third Nun</i>: And Zuleica there, sent all through
Lent to the <i>Morería</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or the Jews’ butcher for red
meat ... and she was swearing it was all for her ape
Gerinaldo!</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: Yes, and the other night I could have
sworn I heard the strains of a Moorish zither coming
from her room and the tapping heels of a <i>juglaresa</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Nun</i> (<i>with a sigh</i>): This house has never been
the same since the sad fall of Sister Isabel.</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: Ay, that must have been a rare time!
Two brats, I think?</p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: And they say her lying in was in the
house of Trotaconventos.</p>

<p><i>Third Nun</i>: Ah, well, as the common folk, and (<i>with
rather a spiteful smile</i>) our dear Sister Assumcion would
say: Who sleeps with dogs rises with fleas—and if we
sin venially, why, the only wonder is that ’tis not
mortally.</p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: Be that as it may, if rumours reach the
ears of the Archbishop there’ll be a rare shower of
penances at the next visitation. Why, the house will
echo for weeks to the mournful strains of <i>Placebo</i> and
<i>Dirige</i>, and there will be few of us, I fear, who will not
forfeit our black veils for a season.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Nun</i>: There is one will keep her black veil
for the honour of the house.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>scornfully</i>): Aye, winds strong
enough to level the Giralda could not blow off the black
veil of Sister Pilar.</p>

<p><i>Third Nun</i>: And yet ... she is a Guzman, and the
streets are bloody from their swords; they are a wild
crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p><i>Fourth Nun</i>: Yes, but a holy one—St. Dominic was
a Guzman.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>mockingly</i>): St. Martin! To the
rescue of your little bird!... as the common folk
and (<i>with an ironical bow to the third nun</i>) Sister Assumcion
would say.</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: What’s that?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Why, it is but a little story that I
sometimes think of when I look at Sister Pilar.</p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: Let’s hear the story.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well, they say that one hot day
a little martin perched on the ground under a tree, and,
spreading out his wings and ruffling his little feathers,
as proud as any canon’s lady at a procession in Holy
Week, he piped out: Were the sky to fall I could hold
it up on my wings! And at that very moment a leaf
from the tree dropped on to his head, and so scared
the poor little bird that he was all of a tremble, and he
spread his wings and away he flew, crying: St. Martin!
To the rescue of your little bird! And that is what we
say in the country when folks carry their heads higher
than their neighbours. (<i>They laugh.</i>)</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: And yet has she kindly motions. Do
you remember when the little novice Ines was crying
her eyes out because she had not the wherewithal to
buy her habit, and thought to die with shame in that
she would need have to make her profession by pittances?
Well, and what must Sister Pilar do but go
to the friend of Ines, little Maria Desquivel, whose
father, they say, is one of the richest merchants in
Seville, feigning that for the good of her soul she would
fain consecrate a purse of money, and some sundries
bequeathed her by an aunt, to the profession of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
novices, and said that she would take it very kind if
Maria and Ines would be these two. And so little Ines
was furnished out with habit, and feather-bed, and
quilt all powdered with stags’ heads and roses, and a
coffer of painted leather, and a dozen spoons, and a
Dominican friar to preach the sermon at her profession,
without expending one blush of shame; in that she
shared the debt with her rich friend. And then, too,
with children she is wonderfully tender.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Nun</i> (<i>with a little shiver</i>): But that cold gray
eye like glass! I verily believe her thoughts are all
... for the last things.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Assumcion</span> gives a little snort. Silence.
<span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> comes out of the convent behind

</div>

<p><i>Fourth Nun</i> (<i>musing</i>): And yet, that book, by a monk
long dead, about the miracles of Our Lady ... it
shows her wondrous lenient to sin, let but the sinners
be loud enough in her praise ... there was the thief
she saved from the gallows because he had said so many
Aves.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: But <i>he</i> was not in religion.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>They all give starts of surprise.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: Jesus! How you startled me!</p>

<p><i>Third Nun</i>: I verily believe you carry a heliotrope
and walk invisible.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>a note of nervousness perceptible
through the insolence of her voice</i>): And are those in
religion to have, forsooth, a smaller share in the spiritual
treasure of the Church than thieves?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> sits down without answering.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i> (<i>smiling</i>): Well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: They say there was once a giant, so
strong that he could have lifted the Sierra Morena and
placed them on the Pyrenees, but one day he happened
on a little stone no bigger than my nail, but so firmly
was it embedded in the ground that all his mighty
strength availed him nothing to make it budge an
inch.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And that little stone is the sin of
a religious?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>with a shrug</i>): Give it whatever meaning
tallies with your humour. (<i>She opens a book and begins
to read it.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>yawning</i>): I’m hungry. Shall I
send Zuleica to beg some marzipan from the Cellaress, or
shall I possess my soul and belly in patience until
dinner-time?</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i> (<i>jocosely</i>): For shame! Gluttony is one
of the deadly sins, is it not, Sister Pilar?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> keeps her eyes fixed on her book without

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Christ and His Mother be with
you, my daughters. (<i>Sits down and mops his brow.</i>)
’Tis wondrous cool and pleasant in your court. (<i>He
gives a shy glance at <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span>, but she continues
to keep her eyes on her book. Turns to fourth nun.</i>)
Well, daughter, and what of the cope you promised
me?</p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i> (<i>holding up her embroidery</i>): See! It
wants but three more roses and one swan.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>with another glance in the direction of</i>
<span class="smcap">Sister Pilar)</span>: And do you know of what the swan is
the figure? In that, flying from man, it makes its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
dwelling in wild, solitary haunts, St. Gregory of
Nazianus holds that it figures the anchorite, and
truly....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>suddenly looking up, and smiling a little</i>):
But what of its love of the lyre and all secular songs,
by which it is wont to be lured to its destruction from
its most secret glens? I have read that this same
failing has led some learned doctors to look upon it
as a figure of the soul of man, drawn hither and thither
by the love of vain things.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>up to now he has spoken in a mincing,
self-conscious voice, but from this point on his voice is
shrill and excited</i>): Yes, yes, but that can also be
interpreted as the love of godly men for sermons and
edification and grave seemly discourse on the beautitudes
of eternal life, and the holy deeds of men and women
long since departed....</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: The love, in short, of such discourse
as yours, father? (<i>She tries in vain to catch
<span class="smcap">Sister Pilar’s</span> eye and wink at her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>pouting like a cross child</i>, sotto voce):
Honey is not for the mouth of the ass.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well, when you joined us, we were
in the midst of just such a discourse. ’Twas touching
the sin of a religious, which Sister Pilar was likening
to a stone of small dimensions, but so heavy that a
mighty giant could not move it.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>turning eagerly to <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span></i>):
Where did you read that <i>exemplum</i>, daughter? I have
not come upon it.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Sister Assumcion has drawn her own
meaning from a little foolish tale. She must surely be
fresh from pondering the Fathers that she is so quick
to find spiritual significations. Is that volume lying
by you (<i>pointing to “Amadis”</i>) one of the works of the
Fathers, sister?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>staring at her insolently</i>): No,
Sister, it is not.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>The other nuns titter.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Well, ’tis doubtless true that a
little sin shows blacker on the soul of a religious than a
great sin on a layman’s soul ... but when it comes to
the weighing in the ghostly scales, a religious has very
heavy things to throw into the balance—Aves and
Paters, though made of nought but air, are heavy things.
Then, there is the nourishment of Christ’s body every
day, making our souls wax fat, and—and—(<i>impatiently</i>)
oh, all the benefits of a religious weigh heavily. The
religious, like a peasant, has a treasure hid ’neath his
bed that will for ever keep the wolf from the door.
(<i>Looks round to see if his conceit is appreciated.</i>) In
Bestiaries, the wolf, you know, is a figure of the
devil.</p>

pedlar’s pack. Throughout the play she is dressed
in scarlet.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>in unctuous, mocking voice</i>): Six hens
to one cock! I verily believe that was the sight that
made Adam weary in Eden. Holy hens and reverend
cock, I bid you good morrow. (<i>She catches <span class="smcap">Sister
Assumcion’s</span> eye and gives a little nod.</i>)</p>

<p><i>The Nuns in chorus</i>: Why, ’tis our good friend
Trotaconventos!</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: For shame! You have sorely neglected
San Miguel these last days. What news in the town?</p>

<p><i>Third Nun</i>: I hear the Ponces gave a tournament
and bull-fight to celebrate a daughter’s wedding, and
that the bridegroom was gored by the bull and the
leeches despair of his recovery—is’t true?</p>

<p><i>Second Nun</i>: What is the latest Moorish song?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: Have you been of late to the Alcazar?
You promised to note for me if Doña Maria wore her
gown cut square or in a peak?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>covering her ears with her hands</i>):
Good ladies, you’ll have me deaf. And do you not
think shame to ask about such worldly matters before
your confessor, there ... and before Sister Pilar?
(<i>turning to <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span></i>). Well, lady, and have the
wings sprouted yet? But bear in mind the proverb
that says, the ant grew wings to its hurt; and why?
Because it took to flying and fell a prey to the birds.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>The nuns exchange glances and giggle. <span class="smcap">Sister
Pilar</span> looks at her with cold disgust.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Truly, you are as well stocked with
proverbs and fables as our sister Assumcion. <i>You</i>,
doubtless, collect them at fairs and peasants’ weddings,
but ... (<i>she breaks off suddenly, bites her lip, colours,
and takes up her book</i>).</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Ah, well, wisdom can walk in a homespun
jerkin as well as in the purple of King Solomon,
eh, Don priest? And as to Sister Assumcion, what if
her speech be freckled with a few wholesome, sun-ripened
proverbs? They will not show on her pretty
face when the nuns of Seville meet the nuns of Toledo
in the contest of beauty, eh, my pretty? (<i><span class="smcap">Sister
Assumcion</span> laughs and tosses her head.</i>) But the reverend
chaplain is looking sourly! It is rare for Trotaconventos
to meet with sour looks from the cloth. Why,
there is not a canon’s house in <i>los Abades</i> that does not
sweetly stink of my perfumes: storax, benjamin, gum,
amber, civet, musk, mosqueta. For do they not say
that holiness and sweet odours are the same? It was
Don Miguel de Caceres—that stout, well-liking canon,
God rest his soul, who lived in the house the choir-master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
has now—and I used to keep his old shaven face as
soft for him as a ripe fig, and I saw to it that he could
drink his pig-skin a day without souring his breath;
well, he used to call me ‘the panther’ of Seville; for
it seems the panther is as many-hued as the peacock,
and the other beasts follow it to their destruction
because of the sweet odours it exudes. And there
were words from Holy Writ he would quote about me—<i>in
odorcur</i> or words to that effect. Nor were the
other branches....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>who had been fidgeting with impatience
at <span class="smcap">Trotaconventos’s</span> verbosity, as usual shrilly
and excitedly</i>): Doubtless the words quoted by the late
canon were, <i>in odore unguentorum tuorum curremus</i>—in
the track of thy perfumes shall we run. They come
in the Song of Songs, the holy <i>redondilla</i> wherewith
Christ Jesus serenades Holy Church, and truly....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>calmly ironical</i>): Truly, Don Jaime,
you are a learned clerk. But as I was saying, it is not
only for my perfumes that they seek me in <i>los Abades</i>.
Don Canon is wont to have a large paunch, and Trotaconventos
was not always as stout as she is now ... there
were doors through which I could glide, while
Don Canon’s bulk, for all his puffing and squeezing,
must stand outside in the street. So in would go
Trotaconventos, as easily as though it were your convent,
ladies, her wallet stuffed with <i>redondillas</i> and <i>coplas</i>,
and all the other learned ballads wherein clerks are
wont to rhyme their sighs and tears and winks and
leers, and thrown in with these were toys of my own
devising—tiring-pins of silver-gilt, barred belts, slashed
shoes, kirtles laced with silk, lotions against freckles
and warts and women’s colics....</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>The nuns, except <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span>, who is apparently
absorbed in her reading, are drinking in every word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
with evident amusement and delight, <span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span>
grows every moment more impatient and bored.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Er—er—the Roman dame, Cleopatra,
the leman of Mark Antony, was also learned in
such matters; she wrote a book on freckles and their
cure and....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: I do not doubt it, Don Jaime. Well,
in would go Trotaconventos, and round her would
flock the pretty little uncoiffed maids, like the doves in
the Cathedral garden when one has crumbs in one’s
wallet. And I would feed them with marzipan and
deck them out with my trinkets, and then they would
sigh and say it was poor cheer going always with eyes
cast on the ground and dressed as soberly as a nun
(<i>she winks at the Nuns</i>) when they had chest upon
chest packed as close as pears in a basket with scarlet
clothes from Bruges and Malines, and gowns of Segovian
cloth and Persian samite, and bandequins from Bagdad,
all stiff with gold and pearls and broidered stories, rich
as the shroud of St. Ferdinand or the banners of the
King of Granada, lying there to fatten the moths till
their parents should get them a husband. And I
would say, ‘Well, when the dog put on velvet breeches
he was as good as his master. There’s none to see but
old Trotaconventos, and <i>she</i> won’t blab. I’d like to
see how this becomes you, and this ... and this.’
And I would have them decked out as gay and fine as
a fairy, and they strutting before the mirror and laughing
and blushing and taking heart of grace. Then my
hand would go up their petticoats, and they would
scream, ‘Ai! ai! Trotaconventos, you are tickling
me!’ and laugh like a child of seven. And I would
say, ‘Ah, my sweeting, there is one could tickle you
better than me.’ And so I would begin Don Canon’s
suit. Ay, and I would keep him posted in her doings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
telling him at what procession she would be at, or in
what church she would hear ‘cock’s mass.’ Or, if it
was to a pretty widow his fancy roved, it was I that
could tell him which days she was due at the church-yard
to pray at her husband’s grave ... aye, as the
proverb says, when the broom sprouts the ass is born
to eat it.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>with a malicious glance at <span class="smcap">Jaime
Rodriguez</span></i>): But another proverb says: Honey is not
for the mouth of the ass.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>with a wink</i>): And yet another says:
Honey lies hid in rocks; and it was not only to the houses
of lords and merchants that I went on Don Canon’s
business. How did I win my name of Trotaconventos?
It was not given me by my gossips at the font. I was
not taught in my catechism that on the seventh day
God created man and woman, and on the eighth day
He created monks and nuns ... were you so taught,
Sister Pilar?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span>, with a petulant sigh, gets up and
goes and examines the arabesques on one of the walls.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>looking up from her book, her eye sparkling
and her cheek flushing</i>): As to that ... I have seen a
painted Bible wherein the Serpent of Eden is depicted
with a wicked old woman’s face.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span> turns round with a shrill cackle.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>chuckling</i>): A good, honest blow,
Sister Pilar! But as the proverb says, the abbot dines
off his singing, and of its own accord the pot does not
fill itself with stew. Howbeit, Sister Pilar, who laughs
last laughs on the right side of his mouth. Well,
ladies, shall we to the parlour? A ship from Tunis
has lately come in, and one from Alexandria, and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
from Genoa, and they tell me I was born under Liber
with the moon in the ascendant, and that draws me
ever to the water’s edge, and sailors have merry kind
hearts and bring me toys, and, it may be, there will be
that among them that will take your fancy.</p>

<p><i>First Nun</i>: We have been burning to know what was
hid in your pack to-day.</p>

<p><i>Third and Second Nun</i>: To the parlour! To the

reading. <span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span> comes up to her and
timidly sits down beside her. Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>in a constrained voice</i>): I am to read
mass to the pilgrims before they start for Guadalupe.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>absently</i>): I should like to go on pilgrimage.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Perhaps ... if ... why do
you never go then?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>smiling a little sadly</i>): Because I want
to keep my own dream of a pilgrimage—nothing but
mountains and rivers and seas and visions and hymns
to Our Lady.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: I fear there are other things as
well: fleas and dust, and tumblers and singers, and
unseemly talk.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Hence I’d liefer go on pilgrimage by
the road of my own dreams. (<i>Passionately</i>) Oh, these
other things, small and pullulating and fertile, and all of
them the spawn of sin! One cannot be rid of them.
Why, even in the Books of Hours, round the grave Latin
psalms the monks must needs draw garlands and
butterflies and hawks and hounds; and we nuns
powder our handiwork—the copes and vestments for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the mass—not with such meet signs as crosses and
emmies, but with swans and true-love knots and birds
and butterflies ... (<i>she breaks off, half laughing</i>). I
would have things plain and grave.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>impatiently</i>): Yes, yes, but you
are forgetting that Nature is the mirror in which is
reflected the thoughts of God; hence, to the discerning
eye, there is nothing mean and trivial, but everything,
everything, is a page in the great book of the Passion
and the Redemption. For him who has learned to
read that book, the Martyrs bleed in roses and in amethysts,
the Confessors keep their council in violets, and
in lilies the Virgins are spotless—not a spray of eglantine,
not a little ant, but is a character in the book of
Nature. Why, without first reading it, the holy
fathers could not crack a little nut; it is the figure of
Christ, said Adam of Saint-Victor—its green husk is
His humanity, its shell the wood of the Cross, its kernel
the heavenly nourishment of the Host. Nay, daughter,
I tell you....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes, yes, but do you verily believe the
nun with her needle, the clerk with his brush, wots
anything of these hidden matters? Nay, it is nought
but vanity. Oh! these multitudinous seeds of vanity
that lie broadcast in every soul, in every mote of sunshine,
in every acre of the earth! There is no soul
built of a substance so closely knit but that it has
crannies wherein these seeds find lodging; and, ere
you can say a pater, lo! they are bourgeoning! ’Tis
like some church that stands four-square to the winds
and sun so long as folk flock there to pray; then comes
a rumour that the Moors are near, and the folks leave
their homes and fly; and then, some day, they may
return, and they will find the stout walls of their church
all starred with jessamine, intagliated with ivy, that
eat and eat until it crumbles to the ground. So many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
<i>little</i> things ... everywhere! And our thoughts ...
say it be the Passion of Our Lord we choose for contemplation;
at first, all is well, the tears flow, ’tis
almost as if we smelled the sweat and dust of the road
to Calvary ... and then, after a little space, we
stare around bewildered, and know that our minds
have broken into scores of little bright thoughts, like
the margins of the Hours, and then ...</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, daughter, but I tell you you
should obtain the key to the Creation; read St. Ambrose’s
<i>Hexæmeron</i>, and thus school your mind by
figures for the naked types of Heaven; there every
house will be a church, its hearth an altar on which, no
longer hid under the species of bread and wine, Jesus
Christ will be for ever enthroned. And its roof will be
supported not by pillars carved into the semblance of
the Patriarchs and Apostles, but by the Patriarchs ...
oh, yes, and the housewife’s store of linen will all be
corporals, and her plate ... you are smiling!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: How happy you must have been playing
with your toys when you were a child! I can see you
with an old wine-keg for an altar, a Moor’s skull for a
chalice, and a mule’s discarded shoe for a pyx, chanting
meaningless words, and rating the other children if
their wits wandered ... but ... you are angry?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>rising in high dudgeon</i>): Aye, ever
mocking! Methinks ... I cannot call to mind ever
reading that holy women of old mocked their confessors.</p>

Ferdinand.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Oh, children, you have been at your
tasks scarce quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><i>Children</i>: Prithee, dear Sister Pilar! We were both
bled this morning.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I fear I am a fond and foolish master.
Well, so be it. (<i>She opens a large folio.</i>) Let me
see....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: ’Twas at the fall of Seville that you left off
yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Yes, and that old Moor had yielded up
the keys.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: This is the place. “Now one of the
keys was of so pure a silver that it seemed to be white,
and in places it was gilded, and it was of a very notable
and exquisite workmanship. In length it was the third
of a cubit. Its stem was hollow and delicately turned,
and it ended in a ball inlaid with divers metals. Round
its guards in curious characters was engraved: God
will open, the King will enter. The circle of its ring
contained an engraved plaque like to a medal, embossed
with flowers and leaves. And in the centre of the hole
was a little plaque threaded with a delicately twisted
cord, and the ring was joined to the stem by a cube of
gold on the four sides of which were embossed alternately
lions and castles. And on the edge of its bulk,
between delicately inlaid arabesques, there was written,
in Hebrew words and Hebrew characters, the same
motto as that on the guards, which is in Latin—‘Rex
Regium aperiet: Rex universæ terræ introibit’—the
King of Kings will open, the King of all the earth
will enter. Some say the key and the whole
incident is a symbol of the Host being lain in the
custodia.”</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Oooh! It must have been a rare
fine key. When I’m a man, may I have such a
key?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I sadly fear, Juanito, that ’tis only to
saints that such keys are given. Think you, you’ll be
a saint some day?</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Not I! They live on lentils and dried
peas. I’ll be a tumbler at the fairs. Already I can
stand on my head ... (<i>catching Pepita’s eye</i>)
nearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: Pooh! Any babe could stand on their head
if some one held their legs.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i> (<i>crestfallen and anxious to change the subject</i>):
Could St. Ferdinand stand on his head?</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i> (<i>much shocked</i>): For shame, Juanito! Sister
Pilar has told us he was a great saint!</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: How great a one?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: A very great one.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: What did he do?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Well, he had a great devotion for Our
Lady and the Eucharist. He founded many convents
and monasteries....</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: Did he found ours?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: It was founded during his reign.</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: How long ago did he live?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: More than a hundred years ... when
your great-great-grandfather was living.</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: There must have been many a nun lived here
since then!</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: How many? A hundred?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: More.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: A thousand?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Maybe.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: A million?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Nay, not quite a million.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Think you, they’d like to be alive again?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Ah! no.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Why?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Because either they are in Paradise or
will go there soon.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Do all nuns go to Paradise?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I ... er ... I hope so.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Will you go?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I hope so.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Will Sister Assumcion go?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I hope so.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Juanito</span> is silent for a second or two, then he
begins to laugh.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: All those nuns, and when they die new ones
coming! Why, it’s like Don Juan Tenorio springing up
again in our game!</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i> (<i>extremely shocked</i>): Oh, Juanito!</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Well, and so it is! And old Domingo says
that his ghost tries o’ nights to steal the live nuns, but
the dead ones beat him back.</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: Yes, and it’s Don Juan that makes the
flowers and the corn grow, and that’s what the game is
that Domingo taught us.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Let me sing it!</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: No, me!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Children! Children! This is all
foolish and evil talk. It is God, as you know well, that
makes the corn grow. You should not listen to old
Domingo.</p>

<p><i>Juanito</i>: Oh, but he tells us fine tales of Roland
and Belermo and the Moorish king that rode on a
zebra.... I like them better than the lives of the
Saints. Come, Pepita, let’s go and play.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>They pick up their balls and run off and begin
tossing them against one of the walls of the court.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>musing</i>): They too ... they too ...
pretty flowers and butterflies upon the margin of the
hours that catch one’s eye and fancy.... Pretty brats
of darkness ... and yet Juanito is only five and is
floating still, a little Moses, on the waters of Baptism.
Soft wax ... but where is the impress of the seal of
the King of Kings? He is a pigmy sinner, and albeit
the vanities pursued by him are tiny things—balls and
sweetmeats and pagan stories—still are they vanities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
and with his growth will they grow. Jesus! My
nightmare vision! Sin, sin, sin everywhere! Babes
turn hideous. Dead birds caught by the fowler and
turned into his deadliest snares. The fiends of hell
shrink to their stature and ape their innocence and
serious eyes; and how many virgins that the love of
no man could have lured, have, through longing
for children, been caught in concupiscence? Oh,
sin and works of darkness, I am so weary of
you!</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dennys</span>, disguised as a mendicant friar.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Christ, and His Mother, and all the Saints
be with you, daughter. Whew! Your porter’s a
lusty-sinewed rogue, and he was loath to let me enter,
saying that he and the maid he’s courting were locked
up in a church by one of my order and not let out till
he had paid toll of all that he had in his purse (<i>throws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
back his head and laughs</i>), and I asked him if the maid
lost something too, but....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>very coldly</i>): What is your pleasure,
brother?</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: My pleasure? Need you ask that of a
mendicant friar? Why, my pleasure is the grease of
St. John of the golden beard, the good sweat of gold
coins—that is my pleasure. “Nothing for myself, yet
drop it into the sack,” as your proverb has it. And, in
truth, ’tis by the sweat of our brow that we, too, live;
oh, we are most learned and diligent advocates, and,
though we may skin our clients’ purses, down to robbing
them of their mule and stripping them of their cloak,
yet we are tireless in their cause, appealing from court
to court till we reach the Supreme Judge and move
Him to set free our poor clients, moaning in the dungeons
of Purgatory. There is no cause too feeble for my
pleading; by my prayers a hundred stepmothers,
fifty money-lenders, eighty monks, and twenty-five
apostate nuns have won to Paradise; so, daughter if
you will but ... (<i>catches sight of <span class="smcap">Pepita</span> and <span class="smcap">Juanito</span>
who have stolen up, and are listening to him open-mouthed</i>)
Godmorrow, lord and lady! I wonder ... has
this poor friar any toy or sugar-plum to please little
lords and ladies? (<i><span class="smcap">Pepita</span> and <span class="smcap">Juanito</span> exchange shy,
excited looks, laugh and hang their heads.</i>) Now, my
hidalgo, tell me would you liefer have a couple of ripe
figs or two hundred years off Purgatory? (<i>He winks
at <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span>, who has been staring at him with a
cold surprise.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i> (<i>laughing and blushing</i>): I’d like to see the
figs before I answer.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i> (<i>with a loud laugh</i>): Well answered, Doña
Doubting Thomas (<i>turning to <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span></i>). You
Spaniards pass at once for the most doubting and the
most credulous of the nations. You believe every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
word of your priest and doubt every word of your
neighbour. Why, I remember ... may I sit down,
daughter?... I remember once at Avila....</p>

<p><i>Pepita</i>: You have not yet shown us these two
figs.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: No, nor I have! As your poor folk say,
“One ‘take’ is worth a score of ‘I’ll gives.’” Give
me your balls. (<i>He makes cabalistic signs over them.</i>)
There now, they are figs, and brebas at that! What,
you don’t believe me? (<i>noticing their disappointed
faces.</i>) It must be at the next meeting, little lord and
lady. Half a dozen for each of you, my word as a tr—— as
a friar. But you must not let me keep you from
your business ... I think you have business with a
ball, over at that wall yonder?</p>

<p><i>Pepita and Juanito</i>: Come and play with us.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: No, no, it would not suit my frock. Another
day, maybe. Listen, get you to your game of ball,
but watch for the Moor who may come swooping down
on you like this (<i>He catches them up in his arms,
they laughing and struggling</i>): fling them over his shoulders
as it were a bag of chestnuts. Then hie for the
ovens of Granada! (<i>He trots them back to the wall, one
perched on either shoulder.</i>) Now, my beauties, you
busy yourselves with your ball and expect the Moor.
But mind! He’ll not come if you call out to him.
(<i>He returns to the bewildered <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span>.</i>) I think that
will keep them quiet and occupied a little space. Well,
I suppose your sisters are having their <i>siesta</i> and dreaming
of ... I’ll sit here a little space if I may, your
court is cool and pleasant.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dennys</i> (<i>looking at her quizzically</i>): So all day long
you sit and dream and sing the Hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>coldly</i>): And is that not the life of a
religious in your country?</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: And so my tongue has betrayed my birth?
Well, it is the Judas of our members. But I am not
ashamed of coming from beyond the Pyrenees. And
as to the life of a religious in France—what with these
roving knaves that call themselves “companions”
and make war on every man, and every woman, too,
and the ungracious Jacquerie that roast good knights
in the sight of their lady wife and children, and sack
nunneries and rape the nuns, why the Hours are apt
to be sung to an un-gregorian tune. And then the
followers of the Regent slaying the followers of the
Provost of Paris in the streets....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Oh, the hate of kings and dukes
and desperate wicked men! Were such as they
but chained, there might be room for peace and
contemplation.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: The hate of kings and dukes and desperate
wicked men! But, daughter, the next best thing to
love is hate. ’Tis the love and hate of dead kings and
lovely dead Infantas has filled the garden-closes with
lilies and roses, and set men dipping cloths in crimson
dye, and broidering them in gold, and breaking
spears in jousts and tourneys ... that love and hate
that never dies, but is embalmed in songs and ballads,
and....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Brother, you are pleading the cause of
sin.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: It has no need of my pleading, lady. Why,
I know most of the cots and castles between here and
the good town of Paris. I have caught great, proud
ladies at rere-supper in their closets, drinking and
jesting and playing on the lute with clerks and valets,
and one of them with his hand beneath her breast,
while her lord snored an echo to the hunter’s horn that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
rang through the woods of his dreams; and in roadside
inns I have met little, laughing nuns, who....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>rising</i>): You speak exceeding strangely
for a friar, nor is it meet I should hear you out.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Nay, daughter, pardon my wild tongue;
the tongue plays ever ape to the ear, and if the ear is
wont to hear more ribald jests than paters, why then
the tongue betrays its company ... nay, daughter,
before you go, resolve me this: <i>what is sin?</i> To my
thinking ’tis the twin-sister of virtue, and none but their
foster-mother knows one from t’other. Are horses
and tourneys and battles sin? Your own St. James
rides a great white charger and leads your chivalry
against the Moors. (<i>With a sly wink</i>) I have met many
an hidalgo who has seen him do it! And we are told
there was once an angelic war in Heaven, and I ween
the lists are ever set before God’s throne, and the
twelve Champions, each with an azure scarf, break lances
for a smile from Our Lady. And as to rich, strange
cloths and jewels, the raiment of your painted wooden
Seville virgins would make the Queen of France herself
look like a beggar maid. And is love sin? The
priests affirm that God is love. Tell me then, daughter,
what is the birth-mark of the twin-sister sin that we
may know and shun her?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>in a very low voice</i>): Death.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Death? (<i>half to himself</i>). Yes, I have seen
it at its work ... that flaunting, wanton page at
Valladolid, taunting the old Jew doctor because ere
long all his knowledge of herbs and precious stones
would not keep him sweet from the worm, and ere
the week was done the pretty page himself cold and
blue and stiff, and all the ladies weeping. And the
burgher’s young wife at Arras, a baby at each breast,
and her good man, his merry blue eyes twinkling,
crying, “Oh, my wife is a provident woman, Dennys,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
and has laid up two pairs of eyes and four hands and
four strong legs and two warm hearts against her old
age and mine” ... then how he laughed! And ere
the babies had cut their first tooth it was violets and
wind-flowers she was nourishing.... Ay, Death ...
when I was a child I mind me, and still sometimes, as
I grow drowsy in my bed, my fancies that have been
hived all day begin to swarm—buzzing, stinging, here,
there, everywhere ... then they take shape, and
start marching soberly two and two, bishops and monks,
and yellow-haired squires, and little pert clerks, and
oh, so many lovely ladies—those ladies that we spoke
of, who being dead have yet a thousand lives in the
dreams of folk alive—Dame Venus, Dame Helena, the
slave-girl Briseis, Queen Iseult, Queen Guinevere, the
Infanta Polyzene; and, although they weep sorely
and beat with their hands, a herald Moor shepherds
them to the dance of the grisly King, who, having
danced a round with each of them, hurls them down
into a black pit ... down which I, too, shortly fall
... to come up at the other side, like figures on
Flemish water-clocks, at the birds matins.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>in an awed voice</i>): Why ... ’tis strange
... but I, too, fall asleep thus!</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i> (<i>shaking his finger at her</i>): For shame,
daughter, for the avowal! It tells of rere-suppers of
lentils and <i>manjar-blanca</i> in the dorter, or, at least, of
faring too fatly in the frater ... what if I blab on
you to the Archbishop? Well, this is a piteous grave
discourse! I had meant to talk to you of Life, and
lo! I have talked of Death.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>as if having come to a sudden

dubbed with a jester’s bladder at a rere-supper of
infantas. I won my spurs when I was fourteen at the
Battle of Salado. Since then I have been in sieges
and skirmishes and night-alarms, enough to dint ten
coats of mail. And because there is great merit in
fighting the Moors, I have permitted myself to sin
lustily. I have even lain with the daughters of Moors
and Jews, for which I went on foot to Compostella
and did sore penance, for it is a heavy sin, and the one
that brought in days gone by the flood upon the earth.
But never have I sinned with the wife or daughter or
kinswoman of my over-lord, or with one of the brides
of Christ. I am from Old Castille, and I cannot forget
my immortal soul. But I verily believe that old witch
Trotaconventos has laid a spell upon me; for she has
so inflamed my blood with her talk of your eyes, your
lashes, your small white teeth, your scarlet lips and
gums, your breasts, your flanks, your ankles ... oh,
I know well the tune to which old bawds trumpet their
wares; and man is so fashioned as to be swayed by
certain words that act on him like charms—such as
“breasts,” “hips,” “lips”—and must as surely burn
at the naming of them as a hound must prick his ears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
and bay at the sound of a distant horn, but it is but
with a small, wavering flame, soon quenched, with a “no,
no, gutter-crone, none of your scurvy, worm-eaten
goods for me!” But when the old witch talked of
you, ’twas with the honeyed tongue of Pandar himself,
the same that stole from the good Knight, Troilus, all
manliness and pride of arms. And she has strangely
stirred my dreams ... they are ever of scaling towers
and mining walls; but, although dreaming, I know well
the towers are not of stone, nor the mines dug in earth
... lady ... I think I am sick ... I——</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>frightened</i>): What ails the man?
... but ... Trotaconventos ... I had not thought
... ’tis all so strange....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>solemnly</i>): Why did you come
to the postern to-night, Sister Assumcion?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>angrily</i>): Why did I come? A
pretty question! I came because of the exceeding importunities
of Trotaconventos, who said you lay sick
for love of me.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>low, sternly</i>): You are the bride
of Christ. Is your profession a light thing?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>shrilly</i>): Profession? Much wish
I had to be professed! I do not know who my mother
was nor who my father. I was reared by the priest of
a little village near the Moorish frontier. He was good-natured
enough so long as the parishioners were regular
with their capons and sucking-pigs laid on the altar
for the souls of the dead, but all he cared for was sport
with his greyhound and ferret, and they said he hadn’t
enough Latin to say the <i>Consecration</i> aright, and that
the souls of his parishioners were in dire peril through
his tongue tripping and stumbling over the office of
Baptism, so ’twas little respect for religion that I
learned in his house. And so little did I dream of being
professed a nun that though the fear of the Moors lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
black over the village, and the other maids could not
go to fill their pitchers at the well or take the goatherds
their midday bread and garlic without their hearts
trembling like a bird, yet as to me I never tired of
hearing the tale of the Infanta Proserpine, who, as she
was weaving garlands in her father’s garden, was
stolen by the Moorish king, Pluton; and I would
pray, yes, pray at the shrine of Our Lady on the hill to
lull my guardian-angel asleep and sheath his sword,
and on that very day to send a fine Moorish knight in
a crimson <i>marlota</i> and armour glittering in the sun,
clattering down the bridle-path to carry me off to
Granada, where, if it had meant a life of ease and
pleasure, I would gladly have bowed down before the
gold and marble Mahound.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: How came you, then, to take
the veil?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>bitterly</i>): Through no choice of my
own. When I was twelve, the priest said he had law
business in Seville, and asked me if I’d like to go with
him. If I’d like to go with him! It was my dream to
see Seville, and I had made in my fancy a silly, simple
picture—a town which was always a great fair, stall
upon stall of bright, glittering merchandise, and laughter
and merriment, and tumblers and dancers, threaded
with a blue river upon which ships with silken sails
and figureheads of heathen gods, laden with lords and
ladies, and painted birds that talked, were ever sailing
up and down, and all small and very brightly coloured,
like the pictures in a merry lewd book of fables by an
old Spanish <i>trovar</i>, Ovid, for which my priest cared more
than for his breviary. And oh, the adventures that
were to wait me there! Well, we set out, I riding
behind him on his mule ... if I shut my eyes it all
comes back as if it were but yesterday.... I jolted
and sore and squeamish from my nearness to him, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
his linen was as foul as were the corporals in his Church
... then the band of merchants and their varlets we
travelled with for greater safety on the road.... It
was bicker, bicker all the time between them and my
priest ... each time we came to a bridge it was,
“Nay, sir priest, we’ll not let you across for you and
your cloth pay naught to their building and upkeep,”
and then.... Oh, ’twas a tedious journey, and took
the heart out of me. Well, we reached Seville towards
dusk ... a close, frowning, dirty town, in truth,
nought but a Morisco settlement such as we had at
home—the houses all blank and grim like dead faces,
and oh! the stink of dogs’ corpses! And not a soul
to be seen for fear of the Guzmans and the Ponces....
And yet I’d catch the whiff of orange-flowers across
the walls, and I heard a voice singing the ballad, <i>Count
Arnaldo</i>, to the lute ... ’tis strange, these two things,
whiffs of orange-flower at night and the <i>Count Arnaldo</i>
... it has ever been the same with me, they turn the
years to come to music and perfume ... or, rather,
’tis as if the years had come and gone, and already I
was old and dreaming them back again. Well, albeit
like a pious little maid, I had said a Pater and Ave for
the parents of St. Julian that he might send me a good
lodging, ’twas to the house of Trotaconventos the priest
took me that night, and it seemed to me indeed an evil
house and she a witch, and I never closed my eyes all
night. Next morning she brought me here, and after
that night, what with its cool dorter and frater, and its
<i>patio</i> and gardens, it seemed like the castle of Rocafrida—the
fairy houses in ballads; and whether I would or
not I became a novice ... a dowerless novice without
clothes or furniture, and never a coin even to give the
servants at Christmas ... and then ... what would
you? Once a novice ’tis wellnigh impossible to ’scape
the black veil (<i>her tone once more bantering</i>). And that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
the end of the story, and may the good things that
come be for all the shire. Did the daughters of the
Moors and Jews tell you such prosy tales?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: You have not yet told me
why you came to the postern to-night.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>in a voice where archness tries to
conceal embarrassment</i>): Why, you must be one of
the monkish knights of Santiago! I feel like a penitent
in the Confessional ... <i>mea culpa, mea culpa, mea
maxima culpa</i>, aha! aha!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>very solemnly</i>): I will know.
Did that old witch in mandragora or henbane, or whatever
be the hellish filters that hold the poison of love,
pour <i>me</i> hurtling and burning through your veins as
you were poured through mine?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Jesus!... I ... she did indeed
please my fancy with the picture that she drew of you
... but come, sir knight! You forget I have not
yet seen your face, much less....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>slowly</i>): So on a cold stomach,
through caprice and a little <i>accidia</i> you were ready to
forfeit eternal bliss and ... I will not mince my
words ... make Our Lord Jesus Christ a cuckold?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well, of all the strange talk! I
vow, Sir Knight, it is as if you blamed me for coming
to the tryst. Have you forgotten how for weeks you
did importune that old witch with prayers and vows
and tears and groans that she should at least contrive I
should hold speech with you to give you a little ease of
your great torment? And what’s more, ’tis full six
weeks since you began plaguing me by proxy; at least,
I have not failed in coyness.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: True, lady, I ask your pardon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
Why should I blame you for my dreams? (<i>half to himself</i>)
a phantom fire laying waste a land of ghosts and
shadows ... then a little wind wafting the smell of
earthly things ... wet flowers and woods ... its
wings dropping wholesome rain and lo! the fantastic
flames with dying hisses vanish in the smoke that
kindled them.... Lips? Lashes? Haunches? I
spoke foolishly; they are not enough. How can I tell
my dreams? (<i>his voice grows wild</i>). Lips straining
towards lips against the pulling back of all the hosts of
Heaven ... a sin so grave as to be own sister to
virtue ... oh! sweetness coming out of horror ...
once my horse’s hoofs crushed a seven years’ old
Moorish maid ... ooh!</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>During the last words, <span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> has crept up
unperceived.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Sister, I missed you at Compline.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Indeed! And in the interval
have you been made prioress or sub-prioress?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Sister Assumcion, this is not the time
for idle taunts. I cannot say I love you, and in this I
know I err, for no religious house can flourish except
Sisters Charity, Meekness, and Peace are professed
among its nuns. But I came for the honour of this house....
God knows its scutcheon is blotted enough ...
have you forgotten Sister Isabel?... believe me I
<i>must</i> speak; it would go ill with me were I to see a
sister take horse for hell and not catch hold of the
bridle, nay, fling my body underneath the hoofs, if
that could stop the progress.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And what is all this tedious
prose? Because, forsooth, feeling faint at Compline,
I crept out to take the evening air.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You lie, sister. Think you I am deaf?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
As I drew near a man’s voice reached me from the other
side of the wall. (<i>Raising her voice.</i>) Most impious of
all would-be adulterers, know that your banns will be
forbidden by the myriad voices of the Church Militant,
the Church Triumphant, <i>and</i> the Church in Torment.
For she (and all nuns do so), who through the watches
of the night prays for the dead, raises up a ghostly
bodyguard to fight for her virginity. Beware of the
dead! They hedge this sister round.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>shrilly</i>): You canting, white-lipped,
sneering witch! You whose breasts are no bigger than
a maid of twelve! You ... you ... this talk comes
ill from you ... do you think me blind? Oh, Sister
Vanity, what of your veil drawn down so modestly to
your eyes in frater or in chapter, but when there are
lay visitors in the parlour, or even Don Jaime gossiping
in the <i>patio</i>, have I not seen that same veil creep up
and up, till it reveals the broad, white brow? Oh, and
the smile hoarded like a miser’s gold that when at last
it is disclosed all may the more marvel at the treasure
of small, white teeth! Oh, swan who loves solitude
but who, of all birds, is the most swayed by the
music of ... mendicant friars!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Silence!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Aha! That shaft went home!
What of the Deadly Sins grimacing behind the masks
of the virtues? Why do you hate me so? Well, I
will tell you. ’Tis the work of our old friend of the
Catechism—Envy, the jaundiced, sour-breathed Don.
Remember, Sister Pilar: Thou shalt not envy thy
sister’s flanks, nor her merry tongue, nor her red lips, nor
any of her body’s members. Over my shoulder to-day,
I saw the look with which you followed the friar and
me.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>in a voice choked with passion</i>): Silence!
you peasant’s bastard! You who have crept into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
house of high born ladies and made it stink with as
rank a smell as though a goat had laid down among
Don Pedro’s Arab mares. Poor mummer! From a
little, red-cheeked, round-eyed peasant girl, I have seen
you moulding yourself to the pattern of our high-born
visitors—from one the shrill laugh, from another the
eyes blackened with kohl, from a third the speech
flowery from <i>Amadis</i> and other profane books—but all
the civet and musk your fancy pours on your image of
yourself cannot drown the peasant’s garlic. You
flatter yourself, Sister Assumcion; <i>I</i>, a Guzman,
whose mother was a Perez, and grandame a Padilla,
how could I for a second envy <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>laughing</i>): But peasant’s blood
can show red in the lips and gums, and a bastard’s
breasts can be as full and firm, her limbs as long and
slender as those of a Guzman or a Padilla. Your rage
betrays you, Sister Pilar. I bid you good-night.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Exit.</i> (<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: My God! Envy! It has a sour smell.
And rage and pride—two other deadly sins whose smell
is ranker than that of any peasant. (<i>Shrilly</i>) Sloth!
Avarice! Gluttony! Lust! Why do you linger?
Your brothers wait for you to begin the feast.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Sinks on her knees.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Oh, heavenly advocate! Sweet Virgin of compassion,
by your seven joys and seven sorrows I beseech
you to intercede for me. I have sinned, I have sinned,
my soul has become loathsome to me. Oh, Blessed
Virgin, a boon, a boon! That either by day or in the
watches of the night, though it be but for a second of
time I may behold the woof of things without the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
warp of sin ... a still, quiet, awful world, and all the
winds asleep.</p>

<h4>ACT II</h4>

<h5>SCENE I</h5>

<div class="scene">

<p><i>A room in <span class="smcap">Trotaconventos’s</span> house. The walls
are hung with bunches of dried herbs and stags’ antlers.
On a table stands a big alembic surrounded by snakes
and lizards preserved in bottles, and porcupines’
quills. <span class="smcap">Trotaconventos</span> is darning a gorget and
talking to <span class="smcap">Don Salomon</span>. The beginning of this
scene is happening simultaneously with the last part
of the previous one.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: A fig for a father’s love! To seek
for it is, as the proverb has it, to seek pears on an elm
tree.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Pardon me, oh pearl of wisdom. Our
Law has shown that a mother’s love is as dross to a
father’s. In the book called Genesis we are told that
when there was the flood of water in the time of Noah,
the fathers fled with their sons to the mountains, and
bore them on their heads that the waters might not
reach them, while the mothers took thought only of
their own safety, and climbed up on the shoulders of
their sons. And at the siege of Jerusalem....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Oh, a pox on you and your devil’s
lore! It is proverbs and songs that catch truth on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
wing, and they tell ever of a mother’s love. Would
you have me believe in your love to Pepita and Juanito
when I saw new hopes and schemes spring up as quickly
in your heart as the flowers on Isabel’s grave....
I never yet have met a man who could mourn the dead;
for them ’tis but the drawing of a rotten molar, a
moment’s sharp pain, and then albeit their gums may
ache a day, they will already be rejoicing in the ease
and freedom won by its removal.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: There was once a young caliph, and
though he had many and great possessions, the only
one he valued a fig was one of his young wives. She
died, and night descended on the soul of the caliph.
One evening her spirit came to him, as firm and tangible
as had been her body, and after much sweet and refreshing
discourse between them, beneath which his
grief melted like dew, she told him that he might at
will evoke her presence, but that each time he did so
he would forfeit a year of life.... He invoked her
the next night, and the next, and the next ... but he
was close on eighty when he died.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>): Just so! The caliph
was a man; you do but confirm my words.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Well, let us consider, then, <i>your</i> love
to your children. First, there was Isabel, and next,
that exceeding handsome damsel, Sister Assumcion ...
nay, nay, it is vain protesting; the whole town knows
she was a cunning brat that all your forty summers
and draughts and chirurgy were powerless to keep out
of the world ... well, these two maids, both lusty
and vegetal, and made for the bearing of fine children,
what must you do but have them both professed in
one of these nunneries ... <i>nunneries</i>! Your ballads
tell of a Moorish king who was wont to exact a yearly
tribute of sixty virgins from your race; what of your
God who exacts more like a thousand?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Out on you, you foul-mouthed
blaspheming Jew! I’d have you bear in mind that
you are in the house of an Old Christian.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Ay, an Old Christian who recked so
little of her law and faith that, just because they paid a
little more, has suckled the brats of the Moriscos!<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Pooh! An old dog does not bark
at a tree-stump; you’ll not scare me with those old,
spiteful whispers of <i>los Abades</i>. Come, drag me before
the <i>alcalde</i> and his court, and I’ll disprove your words
with this old withered breast ... besides, as says
the proverb, He whose father is a judge goes safe to
trial—Trotaconventos walks safe beneath the cloak
of Doña Maria de Padilla, for Queen Blanche dies a
virgin-wife, if there be any virtue in my brews.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: You took it for a threat? Come,
come, you are growing suspicious with advancing
years. But we were talking of your love to your
daughters. Resolve me this: why did you make
them nuns?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Why did I make them nuns?
Because of all professions, it is the most pleasing to
God and His Saints.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: So that was your reason? Well, I
read your action somewhat differently. Of all the
diverse flames that burn and corrode the heart of man,
there is none so fierce as the flames of a mother’s jealousy
of her growing daughters. You have known that
flame—the years that withered your charms were
ripening theirs, and, that you might not endure the
bitterness of seeing them wooed and kissed and bedded,
you gave them—to your God. Wait! I have not yet
said my say. Rumours have reached me of the flame
you have kindled in the breast of an exceeding rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
and noble knight for Sister Assumcion, and that,
albeit, you knew a score of other maids would have been
as good fuel, and brought as good a price; just as some
eight years since, you chose Isabel to kindle the fire
in me. Why? Of all your so-called learned doctors—the
most of them but peasants, trembling, as they
roast the chestnuts on winter nights, at their grandame’s
tales—there is one I do revere, Thomas Aquinas,
for he is deeply read in the divine Aristotle, and, to
boot, he knows the human heart. Well, your Thomas
Aquinas tells of a sin which he calls ‘morose delectation,’
which is the sour pleasure—a dried olive to
palates too jaded now for sweet figs—that monks and
nuns and women past their prime find in the viewing
of, or the hearing of, or the thinking of the bodily joys
of the young and lusty. And ‘morose delectation’ is
never so bitter-sweet as when aroused in a mother by
the amours of her daughter, and this it was that got in
your bosom the upper hand of jealousy and made you
choose your own daughters to inflame the love of this
knight and me.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Well ... by Our Lady ... you
... (<i>bursts out laughing</i>). Why, Don Salomon, in
spite of all your rabbis and rubbish, you have more
good common sense than I had given you credit for!
(<i>laughs again</i>).</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Don Salomon</span>, in spite of himself, gives a little
complacent smile.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Laughter is the best physic; I am
glad to have been able to administer it. But to return
to the real purport of my visit. I tell you, you are
making the convent of San Miguel to stink both far
and wide, and I look upon it as no meet nursery for
Moses and Rebecca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Moses and Rebecca! Truly most
pretty apt names for Christian children! But think
you not that Judas and Jezebel would ring yet sweeter
on the ear? Then, without doubt, their Christian
playmates would pelt them through the streets with
dung and dead mice—Moses and Rebecca, forsooth!
In the city of Seville they will ever be Pepita and
Juanito.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Pepita and Juanito ... foolish,
tripping names to suit the lewd comic imps of hell in
one of your miracle plays. The Talmud teaches there
is great virtue in names, and when they come with me
to Granada they will be Moses and Rebecca.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Go with you to Granada? What
wild tale is this?</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: ’Tis no wild tale. You rated me for
indifference to my children, but I am not so indifferent
as to wish to see them reared in ignorance and superstition
by a flock of empty-headed, vicious nuns who have
become like Aholah and Aholibah, they who committed
whoredoms in Egypt.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Once more, an old dog does not
bark at a tree-stump. <i>You’ll</i> never go to Granada.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: And why not, star-reader?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Because you are of the race of
Judas that sold our Lord for a few sueldos. There
are many leeches more learned than you in Granada,
but none in Castille, therefore....</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i> (<i>indignantly</i>): Whence this knowledge
of the leeches of Granada? Name me one more learned
than I.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>ignoring the interruption</i>): Therefore,
in that in Castille you earn three times what you would
do in Granada, you will continue following the court
from Valladolid to Toledo, from Toledo to Seville, until
the day when you are unable to save Don Pedro’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
favourite slave, and he rifles your treasure and has you
bound with chains and cast into a dungeon to rot
slowly into hell.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i> (<i>quite unmoved</i>): Howbeit, you will
see that to one of my race his children are dearer than
his coffers. Unless this convent gets in better odour,
Moses and Rebecca will soon be playing in Granada
round the Elvira gate, and sailing their boats upon
the Darro ... have you that balsam for me?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Ay, and have you two maravedis
for it?</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i> (<i>taking out two coins from his purse</i>):
Are you, indeed, an Old Christian? Had you no
grandam, who, like your own daughter, was not
averse to a circumcised lover? Methinks you love
gold as much as any Jew.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>drops the coins on the table and listens
to their ring</i>): Yes, they sing in tune; a good Catholic
<i>doremi</i>, I’d not be surprised to hear coins from <i>your
purse</i> whine ‘alleluia’ falsely through their nose—the
thin noise of alloy and a false mint. (<i>Goes and rummages
in a coffer, and with her back turned to him, says
nonchalantly</i>): Neither your ointment nor the Goa
stones powdered in milk have reduced the swelling.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Don Salomon</span> does not answer, and <span class="smcap">Trotaconventos</span>
looks sharply over her shoulder.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Well?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>He looks at her in silence. She walks over to him.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Here is your balsam. As touching
sickness, I have ever hearkened to you; you may
speak.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: The ointment ... I hoped it might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
give you some relief of your pain; but as to the swelling....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: It will not diminish?</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: No.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: You are certain, Don Salomon?</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: But ... surely ... the Table of
Spain, Don Pedro’s carbuncle ... I verily believe
Doña Maria could get me it for a night ... ’tis the
most potent stone in the world.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i>: Dame, you have ever liked plain
speaking. Neither in the belly of the stag, nor in the
womb of the earth, nor in God’s throne, is there a
precious stone that can decrease that swelling.</p>

<p><i>Don Salomon</i> (<i>gravely</i>): Old friend, from my heart I
envy you. A wise man who had travelled over all the
earth came to the court of a certain caliph, and the
caliph asked him whom of all the men he had met on
his wanderings he envied most; and the wise man
answered: ‘Oh, Caliph, ’twas an old blind pauper
whose wife and children were all dead.’ And when
the caliph asked him why he envied one in such sorry
plight, he answered, ‘because the only evil thing is fear,
and he had nought to fear.’ You, too, have nothing
to fear, except you fear the greatest gift of God—sleep.</p>

<p><i>The ghost of <span class="smcap">Don Juan Tenorio</span> appears.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Juan Tenorio</i>: There is no hell.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Who are you? Speak!</p>

<p><i>Don Juan Tenorio</i>: I am the broad path that leads
to salvation; I am the bread made of wheat; I am
the burgeoning of buds and the fall of the leaf; I am
the little white wine of Toro and the red wine of Madrigal;
I am the bronze on the cheek of the labourer
and his dreamless, midday sleep beneath the chestnut
tree; I am the mirth at wedding-wakes; I am the
dance of the Hours whose rhythm lulls kings and
beggars, nuns, and goatherds on the hills, giving them
peace, and freeing them from dreams; I am innocence;
I am immortality; I am Don Juan Tenorio.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Don Juan Tenorio? Then you
come from hell.</p>

<p><i>Don Juan Tenorio</i>: I have spoken: there is no hell.
There is no hell and there is no heaven; there is nought
but the green earth. But men are arrogant and full of
shame, and they hide truth in dreams.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Ay, but what of the black sins that
weigh down my soul?</p>

<p><i>Don Juan Tenorio</i>: Dreams are the only sin.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: What, then, of death?</p>

<p><i>Don Juan Tenorio</i>: Every death is cancelled by a
birth; hence there is no death.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: But I must surely die, and that ere
long.</p>

<p><i>Don Juan Tenorio</i>: But if others live? Prisoners!
Prisoners! Locked up inside yourselves; like children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
born in a dark tower, as their parents were before them.
And round and round they run, and beat their little
hands against the wall, or stare at the old faded arras
upon which fingers, dead a hundred years ago, have
pictured quaint shapes that hint at flowers and birds
and ships. And all the time the creaking door is on
the jar, the gaolers long since dead.</p>

dreams of the living.</p>

infidels.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Manuel de Lara</span>: Old hag, what have you done
to me? You have been riding among the signs of the
Zodiac ... I know ... and tampering with the
Scales, putting sweetness in each, then throwing in
the moon to turn the balance. Oh, you have given
me philtres ... I know, I know ... some varlet
bribed with a scarlet cloak, then strange liquid dreams
curdling the rough juice of the Spanish grape ... and
you all the while jeering and cackling at me! (<i>seizes
her roughly by the shoulders.</i>) How dare you meddle
with my dreams? You play with loaded dice.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>soothingly</i>): Wo! ass! Let me rub
thee down, ass of my wife’s brother! You must have
got an ague; the water of the Guadalquivir and Seville
figs play strange tricks with Castilian stomachs in May.
A little prayer to St. Bartholomew ... or better still,
a very soothing draught I learnt to brew long since
from a Jew doctor. Why, sir knight, what is this talk
of love philtres? The only receipt <i>I</i> know for such is
a gill of neat ankle or merry eye to three gills of hot
young blood. And have you no thanks for your old
witch? I cannot, let evil tongues wag as they will,
drum the moon from the heavens, but trust old Trotaconventos
to draw a nun from her cloister!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>who has been standing as if
stunned</i>): Aye, there’s the rub ... I’d have the
moon dragged from the heavens (<i>laughs wildly, then
turns upon her violently</i>). Oh, I’ll shake your black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
soul out of its prison of rotted bones. I am encompassed
all around with your spells.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Don Manuel, you are sick. Lie
down on this couch and take a cool draught of reason,
for it, at least, is a medicinal stream. You have engendered
your own dreams, there have been no philtres
or spells. The abbot dines off his singing, and a
procuress must suit all tastes, and if a silly serving-wench
comes to me a-sighing and a-sobbing for some
pert groom with a heron’s feather in his cap, or trembling
lest Pedro in her distant village is giving his garlic-scented
kisses to another maid, why, then I know
nothing will salve her red eyes but sunflower seeds
culled when Venus is in the house of the Ram, or a
mumbling backwards of the psalms, on a waxen heart
to melt over the fire. But these are but foolish toys
for the vulgar, and the devil does not reveal his secrets
to an Old Christian who goes to mass every Sunday
and on feast-days too. You are not bewitched, Don
Manuel, except it be by a pair of gray eyes smiling
beneath a nun’s veil. Was she coy, perchance? Why,
coyness in a maid....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>laughing bitterly</i>): Coy?
(<i>impatiently.</i>) I came here all hot with projects and
decision, but now it is all flowing out of me like wine
from a leaking pig-skin, and I seem bereft of will and
desire, as sometimes on the field of battle when I fight
in a dream, regardless if the issue be life or death.
(<i>Shaking himself.</i>) The fault lies not with you, good
dame; what you set out to do you have done, the which
I shall bear in mind. As to spells and philtres, they
say I was born under Saturn with the moon in the
ascendant, and, whether it be true or no, some evil
star distills dark, poisonous vapours round the nettles
and rank roots that grow in the dark places of my soul,
the which some chance word will draw from their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
hiding-place and ... in plain words, your nun is all your
words painted her, but falls far short of the lineaments
lent her by my fancy; for which it is not you but that
same unbridled fancy, that is to blame. In that you
compassed the meeting, you shall have rich cloths and
a well-filled purse, but....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>her indignation boiling over</i>): Jesus!
Here is a dainty Don! Comes far short of the linen lent
her by <i>your</i> fancy! Was then her linen foul? Or rather,
are you like Alfonso the Wise, and had you had the
making of her would you have fashioned her better
than God? I know your breed; as the proverb says, it
is but a fool that wants a bread not made with wheat.
In truth, the girl is well-formed, sprightly and hot-blooded.
I know no damsel can so well....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I have told you dame, you shall
be well paid for your pains. But ... but ... there
is another matter with regard to which I would
fain....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And so you deem old Trotaconventos
cares for naught but cloths and purses! And
what of the pride in my craft? Upon my soul! My
daintiest morsel sniffed at all round, and then Don Cat,
with a hump of his back, his tail arched, and his lips
drawn back in disdain....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Come, dame, I am pressed for
time. I ask your pardon if I have been over nice,
and you have no need to take umbrage for your craft.
I ... would ... would ask your help ... (<i>sinks
into a chair and covers his face with his hands</i>) ... my
God, I cannot. The words choke me.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Hail! Medea of Castille! Your fame has
drawn me all the way from France. Why, ’twill soon
rival the fame of your St. James, and from every corner
of Christendom love-sick wights and ladies will come to
you on pilgrimage.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>laughing and eyeing him with evident
favour</i>): A pox on your flowery tongue! I know you
French of old ... hot tongues and cold, hard hearts.
Oh, you saucy knave; you! But see, your cloak is
wet with dew. Come, I will shake it for you. (<i>Draws
off his cloak and at the same time slips her hand down his

<p><i>Dennys</i>: A truce! A truce! Thus you could
unman me to yield you all my gold and tell you all my
secrets. (<i>Wriggles out of the cloak, leaving it in her
hands.</i>) Do you know the ballad of the Roman knight,
Joseph, and Doña Potiphar?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Ay, that I do; and a poor puling
ballad it is too! But <i>you</i> are no Sir Joseph, my pretty

virgin, fairer and more potent than she of the kings or
of the waters; as with fists and cudgels we will maintain
against all other guilds at Holy Week. Oh! I have

a virtue as unyielding as her body was soft, how....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Out on you, you saucy Frenchman!
It would take a French tongue to call Trotaconventos a
virgin. Why, before you were born ... come, I’ll
tell you a secret. (<i>She whispers something in his ear.
He bursts out laughing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Holy Mother of God! You should have
given suck to Don Ovid. Why, <i>that</i> beats all the French
<i>fabliaux</i>. Well, now as to my business. You must
know I had a wager that, disguised as a mendicant friar,
I would visit undiscovered twenty of the convents of
Seville....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>chuckling</i>): A bold and merry
wager!</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Ay, but that is but the prelude. In one
of these convents (<i><span class="smcap">Don Manuel</span> drops his hands from
his face and sits up straight in his chair</i>) I fell into an
ambush laid by Don Cupid himself.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>bitterly</i>): To be sure! And so you
come to old Trotaconventos. To be a procuress is to
be the cow at the wedding, for ever sacrificed to the
junketings of others. ’Tis other folks’ burdens killed
the ass. Well, the time is short, the time is short, if
you want Trotaconventos’s aid.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Why, despite her habit, ’twas the fairest
maid I have seen this side the Pyrenees, and I swear
’tis a sin she should live a nun. I fell to talking and
laughing with her; but though she is a ripe plum, I
warrant, ’tis for another hand to shake the branch.
Now you, mother, I know, go in and out of every convent
in Seville.... So will you be my most cunning and
subtle ambassador?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Ay, but ambassadors are given
services of gold, and sumpter-mules laden with crimson
cloths, and retinues of servants, and apes and tumblers
and dancers, and purses of gold. How will <i>you</i> equip
your ambassador?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: A <i>trovar’s</i> fortune is his tongue and lips;
so with my lips I pay. (<i>He gives her three smacking
kisses.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Oh, you French jackanapes! Oh,

weigh like <i>maravedis</i>, do you? Well, well, I have
ever said that the lips of a fine lad hold the sweetest
wine in Spain. Now you must acquaint me more fully
with your business, if you would have me speed it.</p>

shameless son of France! <i>France!</i> The
teeming dam of whores and ballad-mongers, whose
king flies from his foes shaking a banner broidered with
the lilies of a frail woman’s garden-close. You are in

strange! That Moorish knight who gave me the head
wound at Gibraltar ... then years later both serenading
’neath the same balcony, in Granada ... and
then again, last year, of a sudden coming on his carved,
olive face staring at the moon from a ditch in Albarrota.
And I convinced, till then, that our lives were being
twisted in one rope to some end.... Chance meetings,
chance partings, chance meetings again. And this
<i>trovar</i>, coming to-night, on business ... why am I so
beset by dreams?</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Thanks, mother, the fiery don shook all
the humours to my head (<i>gets up</i>). Well, knight, more
kicks than ha’pence—that’s the lot of a <i>trovar</i> in Spain.
I know well, necessity makes one embrace poverty and
obedience, like the Franciscans, but I never learnt till
now that a <i>trovar</i> must take the third vow of chastity.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Pooh! A rare champion of chastity
and the vows of nuns you see before you! Why, my
sweet lad, this same Don Manuel de Lara has been
importuning me with prayers and tears and strange
fantastical ravings, that I should devise a meeting
between him ... and whom, think you? Why, this
same Sister Assumcion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Sister Assumcion?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Ay, Sister Assumcion. But, as I
tell him, he is one of these fools that seek a bread not
made of wheat. He’ll not to bed unless I rifle hell for
him and bring him Queen Helena. He comes to me
to-night with a “comely, yes, but comeliness, what of
comeliness?” and “a tempting enough for Pedro and
Juan and the rest of the workaday world, but as to me!”
And she the prettiest nun that ever took the veil, and
certain to bear off the prize for Seville in the contest
of beauty with the nuns of Toledo ... but not good
enough for him, oh no!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Of my thirty years, I have
spent sixteen in fighting the Moors, and if I choose to
squander some of the spiritual treasures I have thus
acquired by my sword in ... (<i>he brings the words out
with difficulty</i>) dallying with nuns, who knows, maybe
<i>I</i> can afford it. But think you I’ll allow a sinewless
French <i>jongleur</i> to rifle the spiritual treasury of Spain?
For Spain is the poorer by every nun that falls. (<i>Impatiently</i>)
Pooh! If two whistling false blackbirds
choose to mate, what care I or Spain? Dame, settle
this fellow’s business with him, then ... I would
claim a hearing for my own.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Well, mother, will you be my advocate?
Tell her I am master of arts in the university of Love,
and have learnt most cunning and pleasant gymnastics
in Italy, unknown to Pyramus and Troilus ... nay,
not that, for maidens want the moon, to wit, a Joseph
with all the cunning in love’s arts of Naso. Tell her
rather, that having been born when Venus was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
house of Saturn, and the scorpion ... you know the
kind of jargon ... I came into the world already
endowed with knowledge of love’s secrets ... nay ...
tell her (<i>his voice catches fire from his words</i>) the years,
like village lads when the Feast of St. John draws near,
have built up in my soul a heap of lusty green branches,
and old dry sticks, and frails of dried rose-petals, and
many a garland of rosemary and maiden-hair and ivy
and rue, and there it has lain until one glance from those
eyes of hers has been the spark to turn it into a crackling,
flaming, fragrant-smoked bonfire, a beacon to a thousand
farms and hamlets. Tell her I can touch the lute,
the vihuela, the guitar, the psalter, Don Tristram’s
harp ... ay, and most delicately touch her breasts.
And if she wishes a little respite from <i>our</i> love, tell her
I can wring tears from her eyes with the Matter of
Britain or the Matter of Rome—sad tales (for sadness
turns sweet when it is dead) of Dido and Iseult and
Guinevere, or make her laugh and laugh again with
tales from the clerk Boccaccio. Tell her....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Enough, French rogue! You have
little need, it seems, of an ambassador. Well, I have
seen worse-favoured lads and (<i>with a scowl in the direction
of <span class="smcap">Don Manuel</span></i>) less honey-tongued. (<i>She rummages
in a cupboard and brings out a key.</i>) What will you give
me for this, Don Nightingale? I’ll tell you a secret;
I have a duplicate key to the postern of near every
convent in Seville, but they are not for <i>all</i> my clients,
oh no! This opens the postern of San Miguel ...
well, well, take it then. And be there to-morrow
night at nine o’clock, and I can promise you your nun
will not fail you.</p>

<p><i>Dennys</i>: Oh, dearer than a mother! oh, most bountiful
dame! A key! A key! (<i>holds up the key</i>), I have
ever loved a key and held it the prettiest toy in Christendom.
I vow ’twas a key and not an apple that Eve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
gave to Adam in Paradise, a key and not an apple the
goddesses strove for on Mount Ida, a key into which
the Roman smith, Vulcan, put all his amorous cunning
when he was minded to fashion a gift well pleasing to
his mistress, Venus. May you dream to-night that
you are young again, mother, and hold the keys of

<p><i><span class="smcap">Don Manuel</span>, who has remained passive and
motionless during the above scene, suddenly springs
to his feet, his eyes blazing, his cheeks flushed.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>hoarsely</i>): I, too, would have a
key ... for the convent of San Miguel.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And would you in truth? (<i>suspiciously</i>).
Has the convent some fairer nun than
Sister Assumcion?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: How can I say? I have never
seen any of the nuns. All I ask you, dame, is for a key.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And what if I refuse you a key, Sir
Arrogance?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I will pay for it all you ask
... even to my immortal soul.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And what do I want with your
immortal soul? I’d as lief have a wild cat in the
house, any market day.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>clenching his fists and glaring
at her fiercely</i>): A key, a key, old hag! Give me a
key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Trotaconventos</span> picks up his scarlet cloak which
he has let drop and waves in his face.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Come, come, brave bull! And has
Love, the <i>bandillero</i>, maddened you with his darts?
Old Trotaconventos must turn bull-fighter! Ah! I
know the human heart! Dog in the manger, like all
men! Too nice yourself for Sister Assumcion, but too
greedy to let another enjoy her!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: A key!</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: No, no, Sir knight. You are not
St. Ferdinand and I am not the Moorish king that I
should yield up the keys of Seville to you without a
parley. Why do you want the key?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>suddenly growing quiet and eyeing
her ironically</i>): What if I have been on pilgrimage
to Jerusalem and found the sun too hot? I have
strange fancies. They say the founder of our house
wed with a heathen witch who danced on the hills.
(<i>Persuasively</i>) Hearken, I know you love rich fabrics;
I have silk coverlets from Malaga that are ballads for
the eye instead of for the ear, silk-threaded heathen
ballads of Mahound and the doves and Almanzor and
his Christian concubine. I have curtains from Almeric—Doña
Maria has none to rival them in the Alcazar—and
so fresh-coloured are the flowers that are embroidered
on them, that when I was a child I thought that I
could smell them, and my mother, to coax me to eat
when a dry, hot wind was parching the <i>Vega</i>, would
tell me the bees had culled the honey spread on my
bread from the flowers embroidered on these curtains.
I have necklets of gold, beaten thin like autumn beech-leaves,
taken by my grandsire from the harems of
Cordova when he stormed the city with St. Ferdinand;
ere they were necklets they were ciboriums of the Goths,
rifled by impious Tarik. Precious stones? I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
rubies like beakers with the red wine trembling to their
very lip ... one almost fears to lift them except with
a steady hand for fear they spill and stain one’s garments
red, and like to wine, the gifts they bring are
health and a merry heart. I have Scythian sapphires
that once lay in the bed of the river of Paradise, while
to win them Arimaspians were fighting Gryphons;
they are the gage of the life to come, they are blue and
cold like English ladies’ eyes who go on pilgrimage.
And I have emeralds to catch from them a blue shadow
like that of a kingfisher on green waters. He who has
store of precious stones need fear neither plague nor
fever, nor fiends, nor the terrors by night, and with
that store I will endow you if you but give me the key.
The key, good mother, the key!</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Very pretty ... but ... well ...
I know a certain king, a mighty ugly one, who laughs at
the virtues of precious stones.... Aye ... but come,
Don Manuel, we are but playing with each other. With
your own eyes you saw me give the key of the Convent
of San Miguel to the French <i>trovar</i>. Think you I have
two?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>as if stunned</i>): Not two?
To the French <i>trovar</i>?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Why, yes, Sir knight. Your wits
are wool-gathering.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>in great excitement</i>): My cloak?
Where is my cloak? Away! the key!</p>

<h5>SCENE II</h5>

<div class="scene">

<p><i>The orchard of San Miguel the following evening
at nine o’clock. Near the postern stands <span class="smcap">Don
Manuel de Lara</span>, motionless, his arms folded, his
cloak drawn round the lower part of his face. Towards
him hurries <span class="smcap">Sister Assumcion</span>.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Good evening, friar <i>trovar</i> ...
and can you not come forward to meet me? I can tell
you, sir, it needed all Trotaconventos’s eloquence to
send me to the tryst. Never before has her pleading
been so honeyed.... Why....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I am not the <i>trovar</i>, lady.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>starting back</i>): Holy saints defend
me! Who, then, are you?... And yet your
voice....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: But I bear a message to you
from the <i>trovar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>sharply</i>): Well?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: His words were these: ‘Tell
her the dead grudge us our joys.’</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: What meant he?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I am a messenger, not a reader
of riddles.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>crossing herself</i>): Strange words!
Where was it that you met him?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: In the streets of Seville ...
at night.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And what was he doing?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: He was standing by a niche
in which was an image of Our Lady with a lamp burning
before it, and by its light he was examining a key.
And he was laughing.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: That is all.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: All? (<i>Shrilly</i>): Who are you?
(<i>Plucks at his cloak which he allows to fall.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Well, and are you any the
wiser?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: No, your face is unknown to me.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And yours to me.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And yet, your voice ... by Our
Lady, you are an ominous, louring man. And this
strange tale of the <i>trovar</i> ... why am I to credit it?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Here is the key.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And where is he?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: That I cannot say.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Did he look sick?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: No, in the very bloom of
health.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And he was standing under a
shrine laughing, and you approached, and he said, “Tell
her the dead grudge us our joys”.... Pooh! It
rings like a foolish ballad.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: It is true nevertheless.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And how came you by the key?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>nonchalantly</i>): The key?
(<i>holding it out in front of him and smiling teasingly</i>). It
is delicately wrought.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>stamping</i>): A madman!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: So many have said. But now,
in that I have borne a message to you, will you return
the grace and bear one for me? I have a kinswoman
in this sisterhood and I would fain speak with her.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>insolently</i>): Have you in truth?
We have no demon’s kinswomen here ... well, and
what is her name?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Sister Pilar.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Aye, <i>she</i> might be ... sprung
from the same still-born, white-blooded grandame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Ah! (<i>with suppressed eagerness</i>).
You know Sister Pilar well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>with a short laugh</i>): Aye, that I do.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And ... is ... is she well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: She is never ailing.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>absently</i>): Never ailing. You
... you know her well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Without doubt, a madman! I
have told you that I know her but too well.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: On what does her talk turn?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: For the most part on our shortcomings.
But her words are few.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>pulling himself together</i>): Well,
you would put me much in your debt if you would
carry her this letter. It bears my credentials as her
kinsman. I would speak with her at once, as I bear
weighty news for her from her home.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: And why could you not come
knocking at the porter’s lodge, as others do, and at some
hour, too, before Compline, when ends the day of a
religious?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: As to the porter’s lodge, I have
my own key. And the news, I tell you, will not keep
till morning. Handle that letter gingerly; it bears the
king’s seal.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>awed</i>): Don Pedro’s?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Aye.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well ... as you will. I’ll take
your message. Good-night ... Sir demon; are you
not of Hell’s chivalry?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: No.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: You are Sister Pilar?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: In the world the Lady Maria
Guzman y Perez?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I am Don Pablo de Guzman,
your father’s cousin’s son.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>with interest</i>): Ah! I have heard my
father speak of yours.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: You have not lately, I think,
visited your home?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Not since I was professed.... <i>I</i> obey
the bull of Pope Boniface, that nuns should keep their
cloister.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Your sister, Violante, has
lately been wed.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>eagerly</i>): Little Violante? She was
but a child when I took the black veil. Whom has she
wedded?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Er ... er ... a comrade in
arms of mine. A knight of Old Castille ... one Don
Manuel de Lara.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: And what manner of man is he? I
should wish little Violante to be happy.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: He passes for a brave soldier.
He has brought her the skulls of many Moors. She has
filled them with earth and planted them with bulbs.
Daffodils grow out of their eyes and nose.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: A strange device!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: ’Twas Don Manuel showed her
it; such are the whimsies of Old Castille. In that
country we like to play with death.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yet ... yet is it not a toy.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: We rarely play with love.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: No.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I would fain learn more of this knight.
He loves my sister?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Ah! yes. His soul snatched
the torch of love from his body, then gave it back again,
then again snatched it. She is all twined round with
his dreams; she smiles at him with his mother’s eyes;
she is Belerma the Fair and Doña Alda of his childhood’s
ballads. She is a fair ship charged with spices,
she is all the flowers that have blossomed since the
Third Day of the Creation, she is the bread not made
with wheat, she ... she ... she is a key, like this
one (<i>holding up the key</i>), but wrought in silver and
ivory.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: A key? Strange! (<i>smiling a little</i>).
And what is he to her?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: He to her? I know not ...
perhaps also a key.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: So you know my home? You have
heard our slaves crooning Moorish melodies from their
quarters on moonlight nights, perchance you have
handled my father’s chessmen and the Portuguese
pennon he won from a French count at Tables ... oh!
he was so proud of that pennon! How is the Cid?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: The Cid? His bones still
moulder in Cardeña.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: No, no, my father’s greyhound ...
the one that has one eye blue and the other brown.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Ah! He still sleeps by day
and bays at the moon o’ nights.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Oh! And how tall has my oak grown
now?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Your oak?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Ah, surely they cannot have forgot to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
show it you! It was the height of a daffodil when I
took the veil. When we were children, you know, we
were told an <i>exemplum</i> of a wise Moor who planted
trees that under their shade his children’s children
might call him blessed, so we—Sancho and Rodrigo
and little Violante and me—we took acorns from the
pigs’ trough and planted them beyond the orchard,
near my mother’s bed of gillyflowers, and mine was the
only one that sent forth shoots. Oh! And the bush
of Granada roses ... they must have shown you
<i>them</i>?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: To be sure! They are still
fragrant.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You know, they were planted from
seeds my grandsire got in the Alhambra when he was
jousting in Granada. My father was wont to call
them his harem of Moorish beauties, and there was a
nightingale that would serenade them every evening
from the Judas tree that shadows them. It was always
to them he sang, he cared not a jot for the other roses
in the garden.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: The rose-tree died of blight and
the nightingale of a broken heart the year you took the
veil.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You are jesting!</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>He smiles, and she gives a little smile back at him.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And so it is of roses and nightingales
that you ask tidings, and not of mother and
father or brothers! Well, it is always thus with exiles.
When I have lain fevered with my wounds very far
from Old Castille, it has been for the river that flows at
the foot of our orchard I have yearned, or for the
green <i>Vega</i> dotted with brown villages and stretching
away towards the <i>Sierra</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I am not an exile.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: An exile is one who is far from
home.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: This is my home.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And do you never yearn for
your other one?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: My <i>other</i> one? Ah, yes!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: By that you mean Paradise?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And so you long for Paradise?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: With a great longing.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I sometimes <i>dream</i> of Paradise.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: And how does it show in your dreams?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>smiling a little</i>): I fear it is
mightily like what the <i>trovares</i>—<i>not</i> the monks—tell us
of hell.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>severely</i>): Then it must be a dream sent
you by a fiend of the Moorish Paradise, which is indeed
hell.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: That may be. And how does
it show in <i>your</i> dreams?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: A great, cool, columned, empty hall,
and I feel at once small and vast and shod with the
wind. And all the while I am aware that the coolness
and vastness and spaciousness of the hall and my body’s
lightness is because there is no sin.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: But what can you know of sin
in a nunnery?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> looks at him suspiciously, but his
expression remains impenetrable.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You must know ... ’tis the scandal
of Christendom ... the empty vows of the religious.
Yet when all’s said, ’tis better here than out in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
world; we <i>do</i> live under rule, and mark the day by
singing the Hours (<i>gazing in front of her as if at some
vision</i>). Just over there, perhaps across that hill, or
round that bend of the road, a cool, rain-washed world,
trees, oxen, men, women, children, thin and transparent,
as if made of crystal.... I always held I
would suddenly come upon it. (<i>Passionately</i>) Oh, I am
so weary of the glare and dust of sin! Everything is
heavy and savourless and confined.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Always?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes ... except when I eat Christ in
the Eucharist.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And then?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Then there is vastness and peace.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: That must be a nun’s communion.
When I eat Our Lord I am filled with a great
pity for His sufferings on Calvary which the Mass commemorates.
There have been times when having eaten
Him on the field of battle, my comrades and I, the
tears have rained down our cheeks, and from our pity
has sprung an exceeding great rage against the infidel
dogs who deny His divinity, and in that day’s battle
it goes ill with them. And when I eat Him in times of
peace, I am filled with a longing to fall upon the Morería,
a sword in one hand, a burning brand in the other.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: It is already very late ... for nuns.
What is the weighty news you bring me?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Why, the marriage of your
sister Violante!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>coldly</i>): And was it for that I was
dragged from the dorter?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I had sworn to acquaint you
with the news ... and to-morrow I leave Seville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>relenting</i>): And you are well acquainted
with Don Manuel de Lara?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>gives a start</i>): Don Manuel de
Lara? Ah, yes ... we are of the same country and
the same age. We were suckled by one foster-mother,
we yawned over one Latin primer, and gloated over the
same tales of chivalry. We learned to ride the same
horse, to fly the same hawk; we were dubbed knight
by the same stroke of the sword—we love the same
lady.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>amazed</i>): <i>You</i> love my sister Violante?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Yes, I love your sister Violante
... and your mother that carried you in her womb,
and your father that begat you. (<i>Violently</i>) By the
rood, I am sick of mummery! <i>I</i> am Don Manuel de Lara.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Yes, I——</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Then you are not the son of my father’s
cousin?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: No.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I ... I am all dumbfounded ...
I ...</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I will make it clear. On
Tuesday night I heard your talk with Sister Assumcion.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>in horror</i>): Oh!...</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I was the man behind the wall
whom you justly named the worst kind of would-be
adulterer, and....</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I have no further words for Sister
Assumcion’s lover.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: <i>I</i> am not Sister Assumcion’s
lover. The moon has already set and risen, the sun
risen and set on his dead body.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>haughtily</i>): I am not an old peasant
woman that you should seek to please me with riddles.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I will read you the riddle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
Some weeks ago I had business—sent from the Alcazar
on a matter pertaining to some herbs—with that old
hag Trotaconventos. And through what motive I
cannot say, she waxed exceeding eloquent on the
charms of Sister Assumcion. We are taught in the
Catechism that the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the
ears, are gates by which either fiends or angels may
enter.... Well, her words entered my ears and set
fire to a great, dry heap of old dreams, old memories,
old hopes ... (strange! these are the <i>trovar’s</i> words!)
piled high on my heart. I became a flame.... You
are of the South, you have never seen a fire consuming
a sun-parched <i>vega</i> in the North. Well, a fire must
work its will, and, devouring all that blocks its path—flowers,
towers, men—drive forward to its secret
bourne. Who knows the bourne of fire? I obtained
speech with Sister Assumcion; it takes many waters
to quench a great fire, but the wind can alter its course.
I heard a voice and strange, passionate words ...
the course of the fire was altered, but still it drives on,
still it consumes.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>in a small, cold voice</i>): Well?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Well? And is it well? My
God! Well, a <i>trovar</i> from France who had entered your
convent disguised as a friar obtained from Trotaconventos
this key, which I likewise desired, first because
it opens this postern, secondly because ... toys are
apt to take for me a vast significance and swell out
with all the potencies of my happiness in this world,
my salvation in the next, and thus it happened with
this key; the fire rushed on, I killed the <i>trovar</i> and took
the key!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>horror-stricken</i>): You <i>killed</i> him?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Yes ... and would have killed
a thousand such for the key ... a low, French <i>jongleur</i>!
The world is all the better for his loss. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
dog! Daring to think he could seduce the nuns of
Spain!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Well?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: The rest is told in few words.
My madness over (for that night I was mad) the key
in my hands, counsel returned to me, and showed me
that it was not only through the key I could win to
your convent ... it is dreams that open only to this
key; strange dreams I only know in fragments ...
and I minded me of an <i>exemplum</i> told by the king
Don Sancho, in his book, of a knight that craved to talk
with a nun, and to affect the same, feigned to be her
kinsman. The night I was the other side this wall and
you were taunting Sister Assumcion, you named yourself
a Guzman whose mother was a Perez. I had but
to go to a herald and learn from him all the particulars
pertaining to the family of Perez y Guzman.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You wished to have speech with me?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Why?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I have already said that no
one knows the bourne of fire.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>scornfully</i>): The bourne of fire! The
bourne rather of ... I’ll not soil my lips with the
word. Let me reduce your “fires,” and “lyres,” and
“moons” to plain, cold words; having wearied of Sister
Assumcion, you thought you’d sample another nun—one
maybe taking a greater stretch of arm to reach;
like children with figs—a bite out of one, then flung
away, then scrambling for another on a higher branch,
that in its turn it, too, may be bitten and thrown. Or,
maybe, Sister Assumcion found the <i>trovar</i> more to her
taste than you ... yes, I have it! <i>I</i> am to bring a
little balm to Sister Assumcion’s discarded lover!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>eagerly</i>): Oh, lady, very light
of ... lady, it is not so. Maybe thus it shows, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
in your heart of hearts you know right well it is not so.
I am a grievous sinner, but my soul is not light nor is
my heart shallow ... and I think already you know ’tis
so. Listen; I could have continued feigning to be your
kinsman and thus I could have come again to speak
with you, and all would have gone well; but your
presence gave me a loathing of my deceit, so I stripped
me of my lies and stand naked at your mercy. As
to Sister Assumcion ... the old hag’s words, when
she spoke of her, mated with my dreams and engendered
<i>you</i> in my heart, yes, <i>you</i>; and I had but to hear the
other’s voice and hearken to her words to know that
I had been duped and that she was not you. I swear
by God Almighty, by the duty I owe to my liege-lord,
by my order of chivalry, that I speak the truth.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Well, suppose it true, what then?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: What then? I have burned
my boats and I shall go ... where? And you will
to your dorter and be summoned by the cock to matins,
and it will all be as a dream (<i>in a voice of agony</i>). No!
No! By all the height and depth of God’s mercy it
cannot be thus! The stars have never said that of all
men I should be the most miserable. Can you see no
pattern traced behind all this? Sin? Aye, sin....
But I verily believe that God loves sinners. But why
do I speak of sin? You say sin is everywhere; tell
me, do you see sin’s shadow lying between us two to-night?
Speak! You do not answer. Who knows?
It may be that for the first time we have stumbled on
the track that leads to Paradise. Angels are abroad
... fiends, too, it may be ... but I am not a light
man. <i>Ex utero ante luciferum amavi te</i> ... ’tis not
thus the words run, but they came.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You speak wildly. What do you want
of me?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: What do I want?... <i>Magna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
opera Domini</i> ... why does the psalter run in my
head?... Great are the works of the Lord ... the
sun is a great work, but so is shade from the sun; and
the moon is a great work, giving coolness and dreams,
and air to breathe is a great work, and so is water to
lave our wounds and slake our throats ... I believe
all the works of the Lord are found in you.... I
could ... oh, God!... Where? Lady, remember
I have the key, and every evening at sundown I shall
be here ... waiting. It is a vow.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> slowly moves away.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Lady Maria! Lady Maria!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>stopping</i>): She is dead. Do you speak
to Sister Pilar?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Yes, that is she, Sister Pilar.
Listen: receive absolution; communicate; be very
instant in prayer; make deep obeisance to the images
of Our Lady. Say many Paters and Aves, and through
the watches of the night, pray for the dead.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>in a frightened voice</i>): For the dead?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Aye, the dead ... that defend
virginity.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>very coldly</i>): All this has ever been my
custom, as a nun, without your admonition.</p>

<h4>ACT III</h4>

<h5>SCENE I</h5>

<div class="scene">

<p><i>A week later. The Chapel of the Convent of San
Miguel. <span class="smcap">Sister Assumcion</span> kneels in the Confessional,
where <span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span> is receiving
penitents.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: I ask your blessing, father. I
confess to Almighty God, and to you, father....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Well, daughter—Ten Commandments,
Seven Deadly Sins. What of the Second Commandment,
which we break whensoever we follow after
vanities?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Yes, father. I have not foregone
blackening my eyes with kohl ... and I have
procured me a crimson scarf the dye of which comes off
on the lips ... and ... the pittance I got at Easter
I have expended upon perfumes.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Ever the same tale, daughter!
As I have told you many a time before, civet and musk
make the angels hold their noses, as though they were
passing an open grave, and a painted woman makes
them turn aside their eyes; but ’tis God Himself that
turns away His eyes when the painted woman is a nun.
The Second Commandment is ever a stumbling-block
to you, daughter, and so is the Sixth, for in God’s sight
he who commits the deadly sin of Rage breaks that
commandment; admit, daughter!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Yes, father; during the singing
of None, I did loudly rate Sister Ines and boxed her
ears.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Shame on you, daughter! Why
did you thus?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Because she had spewed out
on my seat the sage she had been chewing to
clean her teeth after dinner, and, unwittingly, I sat
on it.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: And do you not know that a stained
habit is less ungracious in the eyes of God than a soul
stained with rage against a sister and with irreverence
of His holy service?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Yes, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Well, for your concupiscence, rage,
and unmannerliness: seven penitential psalms with
the Litany on Fridays, and a fare of bread and water
on the Fridays of this month. There still remains the
Tenth Commandment and the deadly sin of Envy; I
mind me in the past you have been guilty of Envy ...
towards more virtuous and richer sisters.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>sternly</i>): Daughter, admit!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Father, I....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Daughter, admit!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: It may be ... a little ...
Sister Pilar.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Aha! Envious of Sister Pilar!
And wherein did you envy her?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Daughter, admit!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: I have envied her, father, but ...
the matter touches her more than me.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: You have envied her. Envy is a
deadly sin; if I’m to give you Absolution I must know
more of the matter.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: I have envied her in that ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
well, in that she was a Guzman ... and ... and has
a room to herself, and a handsome dowry....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Doubtless you envy her for these
things; but ... I seem to detect a particular behind
these generals. Touching what particular matter during
these past days have you envied Sister Pilar?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Daughter, admit!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Oh, father ... ’tis she that is
involved ... I....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Daughter, admit!</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: There was a man ... it was
Trotaconventos ... all he asked was a few words
with me, no more ... nothing ... nothing unseemly
passed between us ... and then he flouted
me ... and then he came bearing a letter and saying
he was a kinsman of Sister Pilar.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Come, daughter, your confession
is like a peasant’s tale—it begins in the middle and
has no end. Why should you envy Sister Pilar this
kinship?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Daughter, it is a dire and awful
thing to keep back aught in the Confessional; admit.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: He was not her kinsman, as it
happens, and ... even had he been....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>eagerly</i>): Well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Father ... pray....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: I begin to understand; your
foolish, vain, envious heart was sore that this knight
treated you coldly, and you have dared to dream that
that most virtuous and holy lady, Sister Pilar....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>hotly</i>): Dreaming? Had you
been in the orchard last evening, and seen what I
saw, you would not speak of dreaming!</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>): What did you
see?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: You have gone too far, daughter,
to turn back now. I must hear all.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well, last evening, just before
Compline, I went down to the orchard to breathe the
cool air; and there I came upon Sister Pilar and this
knight; but they were so deep in talk they did not
perceive me, so I hid behind a tree and listened.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Well, he is, I think, clean mad,
and she, too, is of a most fantastical conceit; and sometimes
their words seemed empty of all sense and meaning,
but sometimes it was as clear as day—little loving
harping upon foolishness and little tricks of speech or
manner, as it might be a country lad and lass wooing
at a saints’ shrine: “there again!” “what?” “You
burred your R like a child whose mouth is full of
chestnuts.” “Nay, I did not!” “Why, yes, I say
you did!” And then a great silence fell on them, she
with her eyes downcast, he devouring her with his, and
the air seemed too heavy for them even to draw their
breath; then up she started, and trembled from head
to foot, and fled to the house.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: But ... but ... yes; thank
you, daughter ... I mean, six paters daily for a
fortnight. (<i>Gabbles mechanically</i>): Dominus noster
Jesus Christus te absolvat: et ego auctoritate ipsius te
absolvo ab omni vinculo excommunicationis et interdicti
in quantum possum, et tu indiges. Deinde ego te<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
absolvo a peccatis tuis, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et
Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Assumcion</span> crosses herself, rises and
leaves the Confessional. After a few seconds, <span class="smcap">Sister
Pilar</span> enters it.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I ask your blessing, father. I confess
to Almighty God, and to you, father....</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Well?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I unwittingly omitted the <i>dipsalma</i>
between two verses in choir, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, yes ... what else?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Last Sunday I chewed the Host with
my back teeth instead of with my front.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, yes, yes; small sins of omission
and negligence ... what else?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: That is all, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: All you have to confess?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: All, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: But ... but ... this is ...
daughter, you <i>dare</i> to come to me with a Saint’s confession?
Bethink you of your week’s ride, ten stone
walls to be cleared clean, seven pits from which to keep
your horse’s hoofs ... not one of the Ten Commandments
broken, daughter? Not one of the Seven
Deadly Sins upon your conscience?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: No, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: But ... beware ... most
solemnly do I conjure you to beware of withholding
aught in the Confessional.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Well, I shall question you. On
what have you meditated by day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: On many things; all lovely.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Of what have you dreamed o’
nights?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Of godly matters, cool cathedrals, and
Jacob’s ladder.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Of man?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>threateningly</i>): Daughter! Admit!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Sometimes ... I ... have dreamed
of man.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Of <i>a</i> man?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Of a monk dwelling in the same community
who has sometimes knelt at the altar by my
side to receive the Lord.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: But this is not a mixed community.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: No, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: What of this monk, then?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: You asked me, father, of my dreams.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: And had this monk of dreams the
features of a living man?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes, father.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>hoarsely</i>): Whose?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Sometimes they were the features of my
father ... one night of an old Basque gardener we
had in my home when I was a child.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Pooh! Daughter, you are holding
something back.... Beware! What of your allegory
of the little stone the giant could not move?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I have confessed <i>all my sins</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Daughter, I refuse to give you
Absolution.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> crosses herself, rises, and goes out
of the chapel. <span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span> leaves the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
confessional looking pale and tormented; he is
accosted by <span class="smcap">Trotaconventos</span>, who has been sitting
waiting.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: A word with you, Don Jaime.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Anon, anon, good dame. I have
pressing business in the town.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Your business can wait, but not my
words. They touch Sister Pilar. (<i>He starts violently
and looks at her expectantly.</i>) You see, you will not to
your business till I am done with you ... just one
little word to bind you to my will! And in that I ever
know the little word that will make men hurrying to
church or market stand still as you are doing now, or
else if they be standing still to run like zebras: they
call me a witch.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, yes, but you said you had
... a word ... touching ... for my ear.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And so I have, Don Jaime; I am
making my soul. A hard job, your eyes say. Well,
with my brushes and ointments I can make the complexion
of a brown witch as fair as a lily, I can make
an old face slough its wrinkles like a snake its skin in
spring; and who knows what true penitence will not
do to my soul?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Good dame, I beseech you, to
business!</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And is not the saving of my soul
business, if you please?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, your confessor’s ... in
truth, dame, I am much pressed for time.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And yet, though time, or the lack
of him, expresses all the marrow from your bones,
because of that little name you cannot move till I have
said my say. Is it true that St. Mary Magdalene was
once a bawd and a maker of cosmetics?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>with weary resignation</i>): Aye.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And did you ever hear that she sold
her daughter to a Jew, and that daughter a nun?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>in horror</i>): Never!</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: But if she had, would her tears of
penitence have washed it out?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, if she had confessed it and
done penance.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And what is more, become herself a
scourge of sinners and saved the souls of two innocent
babes for the Church?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: Yes, thus would she have acquired
merit.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Well, I have brought as many maids
to bed that multiplied by ten you will have baptised
and buried when you are three score years and ten....
Why! it is no more to me than it was to my old father,
who owned some land Carmona way, to take a heifer
to bull. In truth, if Don Love still reigned in heaven
and had not fallen with Satan into hell, your children’s
children would be praying to <i>Saint</i> Trotaconventos that
she would send them kisses and ribbons and moonless
nights; my bones would be lying under the altar of
some parish church, and two of my teeth in a fine golden
reliquary would cure maids of pimples, lads of warts.
All that lies very lightly on my soul ... but there
are other things ... and ... (<i>looking round furtively</i>)
these nights I’ve sometimes wished for a dog that I
might hear his snore.... What if before she died
Trotaconventos should be re-christened Convent-Scourge?
I have learned ... oh, one of my trade needs
must have as many eyes as the cow-herd of the Roman
dame, I forget what the <i>trovares</i> call her, and as many
ears as eyes ... that a certain nun of this convent
... you grow restive? Why, then, once more I must
whisper the magic name and root you to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
<i>Sister Pilar</i> is deep in an <i>amour</i> with a knight of the
Court ... an overbearing, vain, foolish man against
whom I bear a grudge. And Trotaconventos means,
before she dies, on one nun at least in place of opening,
to shut the convent gate; nay, to bring her to her
knees and penitence. Well, what think you?</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: There is some dark thought
brooding in your heart, and, unlike the crow, I deem it
will hatch out acts black as itself,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the whiteness
of her virtue will not be soiled.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: And is Sister Pilar too firmly settled
in her niche to topple down? Yet how she laughs at
you! Why, I have heard her say that you are neither
man nor priest, but just a bundle of hay dressed up in
a soutane, whose head is a hollow pumpkin holding a
burning candle, to frighten boors and children with
death and judgment on the eve of All Souls.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>hotly</i>): She said that? When?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Why, I cannot mind me of the date;
she has used you so often as a strop for sharpening her
tongue. But let me unfold my plan. Maybe you know
I am ever in and out of the Alcazar with draughts and
oils and unguents ... and other toys that shall be
nameless ... for Doña Maria. Poor soul! The fiends
torment her, too, and she clutches at aught that may
serve as atonement. I told her the story, and she was
all agog to be the instrument for restoring the good
name to the convents of Seville. She thanked me
kindly for my communication, and sent her <i>camarero</i>
to fetch me a roll of Malaga silk, and then she went to
Don Pedro feigning ignorance of the knight’s name—for,
next to his carbuncle, Don Pedro puts his faith in
the strong right arm of Don Manuel de Lara—told him
the tale, and wheedled from him a writ signed with the
royal seal, the name to be filled in when she had learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
it, for he is very jealous of the right which it seems
alone among the Kings of Christendom is his—to punish
infringements of canon, as well as of civil law. I have
the writ, and towards sundown I shall come to the
convent orchard with three alguaciles<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to tear the
canting Judas from his lady’s arms.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>in horror</i>): Her arms? Nay, not
that....</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Why, yes; her arms and lips. Come,
come, Sir Priest, think you it is with the feet and nose
lovers embrace?</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Jaime Rodriguez</span> continues to gaze at her in
horror.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i> (<i>chuckling</i>): Oh, well I know the clerks
of your kidney! Your talk would bring a blush to
a bawd, and you’ll hold your sides and smack your lips
over French fables and the like; but when it comes to
flesh and hot blood and <i>doing</i>, you’ll draw down your
upper lip, turn up your eyes, and cry, “But it’s not
true. It cannot be!” Come, pull yourself together—’tis
you must be the fowler of the nun.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>starting</i>): I?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: You.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i>: But the discipline of nuns lies
with the Chapter.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Yes, yes, but, ’tis the common
talk of Seville that the Prioress here is too busy
with little hounds and apes and flutings and silk
veils to care for discipline ... you’ll not get her
wetting her slashed shoes in the orchard dew. You,
the chaplain of this house, must meet me to-night
outside the orchard’s postern to catch the nun red-handed
and drag her before the Prioress.... Ah!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
to-night you’ll see whether it be only in songs and
tales and little lewd painted pictures that folks know
how to kiss!</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>violently</i>): I’ll not be there!</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Not there? Why, Sister Pilar
spoke truly: “neither man nor priest”—not man
enough to take vengeance on his spurner, not priest
enough to chastise a sinner.</p>

<p><i>Jaime Rodriguez</i> (<i>in a fury of despair</i>): Ah! I will
be there.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i>He rushes from the chapel. <span class="smcap">Trotaconventos</span>
looks after him, a slow smile spreading over her face,
and she nods her head with satisfaction. Enter
<span class="smcap">Sister Assumcion</span>.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: Aha! my little pigeon, how goes the
world? Has my lotion cured that little roughness on
your cheek? Come, my beauty, let me feel (<i>she draws
her hand down her cheek</i>). Why, yes, it’s as smooth and
satiny as a queen-apple (<i>makes a scornful exclamation</i>).
And so that lantern-jawed Knight prefers Sister Whey
to Sister Cream! Well, he’ll get well churned for his
pains. Oh, the nasty Templar come to life ... oh,
the pompous fool, marching with solemn gait like
a lord abbot frowning over a great paunch because,
forsooth, he has swallowed the moon and she has dissolved
into humours in his belly! Oh ... oh ...
with “good dame, do this,” and “good dame, do that,”
as though I were his slave ... ’tis sweet when duty
and vengeance chime together. (<i>Looking maliciously at
Sister Assumcion.</i>) Spurned, too, by the pretty French
<i>trovar</i>! Why, it is indeed a deserted damsel! Oh,
you needn’t blush and toss your head; when I was of
your age and your complexion, I could land a fish as
well as throw a line. (<i>Melting.</i>) Never mind, poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
poppet, you were wise in that you came to me with your
tale of Don Joseph and my lady Susannah for once
caught napping ... and that in each other’s arms.
I have devised a pretty vengeance which I will unfold to
you. Aye! you’ll see that proud white Guzman without
her black veil, last in choir for the rest of her days,
and every week going barefoot round the cloister while
the Prioress drubs her! And the sallow knight who
thought my cream had turned when it was but his own
sour stomach ... he’ll have to sell his Moorish loot to
buy waxen tapers, and be beaten round all the churches
of Seville ... may I live to see the day! Never was
there a sweeter medicine whereby to save one’s soul,
than vengeance on one’s foes. (<i>She pauses for a few
seconds, and a strange light comes into her eyes.</i>) Don
Juan Tenorio, I have made my choice—I fight with the
dead. (<i>shakes her fist at the audience</i>) Arrogant, flaunting
youth! Beauty! Hot blood! From the brink

<h5>SCENE II</h5>

<div class="scene">

<p><i>The evening of the same day. The convent orchard.
<span class="smcap">Sister Pilar</span> and <span class="smcap">Don Manuel de Lara</span> are lying
locked in each other’s arms. She extricates herself
and sits up.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>very slowly</i>): You ... have ...
ravished ... me.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>): Yes, eyes of
my heart; I have unlocked your sweet body.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Strange! Has my prayer been answered?
And by whom?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: What prayer, beloved?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: That night you were the other side of the
wall, I prayed that I might behold the woof without the
warp of sin, a still, quiet, awful world, and all the winds
asleep. (<i>Very low.</i>) <span class="allsmcap">IT</span> was like that. (<i>Springing to
her feet.</i>) Christ Jesus! Blessed Virgin! Guardian
angel, where was your sword? I, a nun, a bride of
Christ, I have been ravished. I am fallen lower than
the lowest woman of the town, I have forfeited my
immortal soul. (<i>Sobbing, she sinks down again beside
<span class="smcap">Don Manuel</span>, and lays her head on his shoulder.</i>)
Beloved! Why have you brought me to this?
Why, my beloved?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>caressing her</i>): Hush, little
love, hush! Your body is small and thin ... hush!</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: But how came it to fall out thus?
Why?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Because there was something
stronger than the angels, than all the hosts of the
dead.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: What?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: I cannot say ... something
... I feel it—yet, where are these words? They have
suddenly come to me: <i>amor morte fortior</i>—against love
the dead whose aid you, and I, too, invoked, cannot
prevail.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>shuddering</i>): Yet the dead kept Sister
Assumcion from her <i>trovar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Their souls were barques too
light to be freighted with love; for it is very heavy.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: And so they did not sink.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Who can tell if lightness of
soul be not the greatest sin of all? And as to us ...
the proverb says the paths that lead to God are infinite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
... beloved, I feel.... Something holy is with us
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Fiends, fiends, wearing the weeds of
angels.... (<i>Groans.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Rest, small love ... there,
I’ll put my cloak for your head. Why is your body so
thin and small?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>her eyes fixed in horror</i>): I cannot believe
that it is really so. A week since, yesterday, an hour
since, I ... was ... a ... a ... virgin, and now
... can God wipe out the past?</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Nay ... nor would I have
Him do so.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Beloved ... we have sinned ...
most grievously.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: What is sin? I would seem
to have forgotten. What is sin, beloved? Be my
herald and read me his arms.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Death ... I have said that before
... ah, yes, to the <i>trovar</i> ... death, death....</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: With us is neither sin nor
death. You yourself said that during <span class="allsmcap">IT</span> sin vanished.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes ... so it seemed ... (<i>almost
inaudibly</i>) ’twas what I feel, only ten times multiplied,
when I eat Christ in the Eucharist.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Hush, beloved, hush! You
are speaking wildly.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Oh! what did I say? Yes, they were
wild words.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Do you know, we are in the octave of
the Feast of Corpus Christi? I seem to have fallen
from the wheel of the Calendar to which I have been
tied all my life ... saints, apostles, virgins, martyrs,
rolled round, rolled round, year after year ... like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
the Kings and Popes and beggars on the Wheel of
Fortune in my mother’s book of Hours. Yes, beloved,
we have fallen off the wheel and are lying stunned in
its shadow among the nettles and deadly night-shade;
but above us, creaking, creaking, the old wheel turns.
It may be we are dead ... are we dead, beloved?</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>): Quick! Quick!
Not a moment ... they’ll be here! I cannot ...
quick! (<i>She presses her hand to her side in great agitation</i>).</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: What is all this? Speak, lady.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Trotaconventos ... Don Jaime
... the <i>alguaciles</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Take your time, lady. When
you have recovered your breath you will tell us what
all this portends.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Away! Away! Trotaconventos
has been to Don Pedro ... she has a writ against you

Don Jaime comes to catch Sister Pilar ... fly! fly!
ere ’tis too late.</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i> (<i>dully</i>): Caught up again on the wheel
... death’s wheel, and it will crush us.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i> (<i>shaking her</i>): Rouse yourself,
sister! You yet have time.</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: We are together, beloved ...
do you fear?</p>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: No ... I neither fear, nor hope, nor
breathe.</p>

<p><i>Sister Assumcion</i>: Mad, both of them! I tell you,
they come with the <i>alguaciles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: And if they came with all the
hosts of Christendom and Barbary, yet should you
see what you will see. I have a key, and I could lock
the postern, but I’ll not do so. (<i>He picks up his sword,
girds it on, and draws it.</i>) Why ... all the Spring
flows in my veins to-day.... I am the Spring. What
man can fight the Spring?</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: There, my brave lads, I told you!
Caught in the act ... the new Don Juan Tenorio and
his veiled concubine!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Silence, you filthy, bawdy
hag! (<i>glares at her.</i>) Here stand I, Don Manuel de Lara,
and here stands a very noble lady of Spain and a bride
of Christ, and here is my sword. Who will lay hands on
us? You, Don Priest, pallid and gibbering? You, vile
old woman, whose rotten bones need but a touch to
crumble to dust and free your black soul for hell?
You ... (<i>his eyes rest on the alguaciles</i>). Why! By
the rood ... ’tis Sancho and Domingo and Pedro!
Old comrades, you and I, beneath the rain of heaven
and of Moorish arrows have buried our dead; we have
sat by the camp-fire thrumming our lutes or capping
riddles (<i>laughs</i>). How does it go? “I am both hot
and cold, and fish swim in me without my being a
river,” and the answer is a frying-pan ... and in the
cold dawn of battle we have kneeled side by side and

Remember, you carry a warrant with Don Pedro’s seal.</p>

<p><i>Sancho</i> (<i>dubiously</i>): ’Tis true, captain, we carry a
royal warrant for your apprehension.</p>

<p><i>Trotaconventos</i>: At him! At him!</p>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: At me then! Air! Fire!
Water! A million million banners of green leaves! A
mighty army of all the lovers who have ever loved!
Come, then, and fight them in me! <i>You</i>, too, were there
that day when the whole army saw the awful ærial
warrior before whom the Moors melted like snow ...
what earthly arrows could pierce his star-forged mail?
I, too, have been a journey to the stars. I wait!
At me!</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

his own showing, he is but a tumbler at a fair in a suit
of motley covered with spangles, or a Jack-in-the-green
at a village May-day. Come to your senses, good

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i> (<i>loudly and triumphantly</i>): His

darkness: for the assault of the evil one in the noon-day.

crouching under a tree, her teeth chattering, and goes
down on her knees before her.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: I confess to Almighty God, and to you,
little sister, because I have sinned against you exceedingly,
in thought, word and deed (<i>she strikes her breast
three times</i>), through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault. You were wiser than
I, little sister, and knew me better than I knew myself.
I deemed my soul to be set on heavenly things, but
therein was I grievously mistaken. When I chid you
for wantonness, thinking it was zeal for the honour of
the house, it was naught, as you most truly said, but
envy of you, in that you gave free rein to your tongue
and your desires. And, though little did I wot of it, I
craved for the love of man as much as ever did you, nay,
more. Even that poor wretch, Don Jaime ... it was
as if I came more alive when I talked with him than
when I was in frater or in dorter with naught but
women. Then that poor <i>trovar</i> ... he gave me a
longing for the very things I did most condemn in talk
with him ... the merry rout of life, all noise and
laughter and busyness and perfumed women. Then
when he gazed at you as does a prisoner set free gaze at
the earth, my heart seemed to contract, my blood to
dry up, and I hated you. And then ... and then
... there came Don Manuel, and time seemed to cease,
eternity to begin. All my far-flown dreams came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
crowding back to me like homing birds; envy, rage,
pride dropped suddenly dead, like winds in a great
calm at sea ... and that great calm was ... Lust.</p>

<div class="stage-direction">

<p><i><span class="smcap">Don Manuel</span>, who has been standing motionless,

</div>

<p><i>Sister Pilar</i>: Yes ... Lust. Little sister, I verily
believe that in spite of foolishness and vanity, all the
sins of this community are venial ... excepting mine.
For I am Christ’s adulteress (<i><span class="smcap">Don Manuel</span> starts forward
with a stifled cry, but she checks him with upraised hand</i>),
a thing that Jezebel would have the right to spurn
with her foot ... yes, little sister, I, a bride of Christ,
have been ravished. (<i>Seizing her hands.</i>) Poor little
sister ... just a wild bird beating its wings against a
cage through venial longings for air and sun! I am not
worthy to loose the latchet of your shoe.</p>

me for you ... and I told Trotaconventos ... and
Don Jaime ... and it is all my doing ... and ’tis I

</div>

<p><i>Don Manuel de Lara</i>: Oh, very soul of my soul!
White heart of hell wherein I must burn for all eternity!
I see it now ... we have been asleep and we have
wakened ... or, maybe, we have been awake and now
we have fallen asleep. Look! look at the evening
star caught in the white blossom—the tree’s cold,
virginal fruition (<i>springs to his feet</i>). Vespers ... the
Evening Star ... bells and stars and Hours, they are
leagued against me ... and yet I thought ... is it
the living or the dead? I cannot fight stars ...
wheels ... the Host ... Beloved, will you sometimes
dream of me? No need to answer, because I
know you will. Our dreams ... God exacts no levy
on our dreams ... the angels dare not touch them
... they are ours. First, heavy penance, then, maybe,
if I win forgiveness, the white habit of St. Bruno.
When you are singing Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None,
Vespers, and Compline, I, too, shall be singing them—through
the long years. God is merciful and the
Church is the full granery of His Grace ... maybe He
will pardon us; but it will be for <i>your</i> soul that I shall
pray, not mine.</p>

liked the troubadour’s jolly red boots; are they what
are called Cossack boots? Oh, no, of course, that’s
Russian.”</p>

<p>But it was clear they were all horribly embarrassed.</p>

<p>The babies and children had, for some time, been
getting fretful; and now the babies were giving their
nerve-rending catcalls, the children their heart-rending
keening.</p>

<p>In one of her moments of insight, Jollypot had said
that there is nothing that brings home to one so forcibly
the suffering involved in merely being alive as the
change that takes place in the cry of a child between
its first and its fourth year.</p>

<p>But the children were soon being comforted with
buns; the babies with great, veined, brown-nippled
breasts, while Mrs. Moore, markedly avoiding any
member of the Lane family, moved about among her
women with pursed mouth.</p>

<p>Then the actors appeared, still in their costumes,
and mingled with the other guests, drinking tea and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
chatting. The Doña, eyebrows quizzically arched,
came up to Teresa.</p>

<p>“My dear child, what <i>were</i> you thinking of? Just
look at Mrs. Moore’s face! That, of course, makes up
for a lot ... but, still! And I do hope they won’t
think Spanish convents are like that nowadays.”</p>

<p>Thank goodness! The Doña, at least, had not smelt
a rat.</p>

<p>Then she saw Guy coming towards her; for some
reason or other, he looked relieved.</p>

<p>“I wish to God Haines would make his people stylisize
their acting more—make them talk in more artificial
voices in that sort of play. They ought to speak like
the Shades in Homer; that would preserve the sense
of the Past. There’s nothing that can be so modern
as a voice.” He looked at her. “It’s funny ...
you know, it’s not the sort of thing one would have
expected you to write. It has a certain gush and exuberance,
but it’s disgustingly pretty ... it really is,
Teresa! Of course, one does get thrills every now
and then, but I’m not sure if they’re legitimate ones—for
instance, in the last scene but one, when Don Manuel
becomes identified with the Year-Spirit.”</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was it! He had feared that, according to
his own canons, it would be much better than it was;
hence his look of relief. She had a sudden vision of
what he had feared a thing written by her would be
like—something black and white, and slightly mathematical;
dominoes, perhaps, which, given that the
simple rule is observed that like numbers must be placed
beside like, can follow as eccentric a course as the
players choose, now in a straight line, now zigzagging,
now going off at right angles, now again in a straight
line; a sort of visible music. And, indeed, that line of
ivory deeply indentured with the strong, black dots
would be like the design, only stronger and clearer, made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
by an actual page of music; like that in a portrait
she had once seen by Degas of a lady standing by a
piano.</p>

<p>But she felt genuinely glad that her play should
have achieved this, at least, that one person should feel
happier because of it; and she was quite sincere when
she said, “Well, Guy, it’s an ill wind, you know.”</p>

<p>He grew very red. “I haven’t the least idea what
you mean,” he said angrily.</p>

<p>After that, Concha came up, and was very warm in
her congratulations. Did she guess? If she did, she
would rather die than show that she did. Teresa began
to blush, and it struck her how amused Concha must
be feeling, if she <i>had</i> guessed, at the collapse of Sister
Assumcion’s love affairs, and at the final scene between
Pilar and Assumcion—Pilar’s noble self-abasement,
Assumcion’s confession of her own inferiority.</p>

<p>And David? He kept away from her, and she
noticed that he was very white, and that his expression
was no longer buoyant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>

</div>

<p>That evening Teresa got no word alone with David.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast it was proposed that
Dick, Concha and Rory, and Arnold, should motor
to the nearest links, play a round or two, and have
luncheon at the clubhouse; and David asked if he
might go with them to “caddy.”</p>

<p>Harry and Guy had to leave by an early train.</p>

<p>The day wore on; and Teresa noticed that the Doña
kept looking at her anxiously, in a way that she used to
look at her when she was a child and had a bad cold.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she took a book and went down to
the orchard; but she could not read. The bloom was
on the plums; the apples were reddening.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At about four o’clock there was the sound of footsteps
behind her, and looking round she saw David.
He was very white.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to say good-bye,” he said.</p>

<p>“<i>Good-bye?</i> But I thought ... you were staying
some days.”</p>

<p>“No ... I doubt I must be getting back. I told
Mrs. Lane last night, I’m going by the five-thirty.”</p>

<p>He stood gazing down at her, looking very troubled.</p>

<p>“Why have you suddenly changed your plans?”
she said, in a very low voice.</p>

<p>He gazed at her in silence for a few seconds, and
then said, “I’m not so sure if I had any ... well, any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
<i>plans</i>, so to speak, to change ... at least, I hope ...
but, anyway, I’m going ... now,” and he paused.</p>

<p>She felt as if she were losing hold of things, as in
the last few seconds of chloroform, before one goes
off.</p>

<p>“That play of yours ... that Don ... he was a
great sinner,” he was saying.</p>

<p>“He repented,” she said, in a small, dry voice.</p>

<p>“After ... he’d had what he wanted. That’s a
nice sort of repentance!” and he laughed harshly.</p>

<p>From far away a cock, then another, gave its strange,
double-edged cry—a cry, which, like Hermes, is at
once the herald of the morning and all its radiant
denizens, and the marshaller to their dim abode of
the light troupe of passionate ghosts: Clerk Saunders
and Maid Margaret, Cathy and Heathcliff.</p>

<p>He laughed again, this time a little wildly: “Hark
to the voice of one in the wilderness crying, ‘repent
ye!’ Do you remember Newman’s translation of
the <i>Æterne Rerum Conditor</i>? How does it go again?
Wait ...</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Its rhythm, when his voice stopped, continued
rumbling dully along the surface of her mind....
Once it wrought a great repenting in that flood of
Peter’s tears.... Once it wrought a.... Funny!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It would have to be “in that flood of Peter’s <i>mind</i>....”
Not very good.... What was he saying now?</p>

<p>“I remember your saying once that the Scotch
thought an awful lot about the sinfulness of sin....
I firmly believe that the power of remitting sin has been
given to the priests of God ... but are we, like that
knight, going to ... well to exploit, that grand
expression of God’s mercy to His creatures, the Sacrament
of Penance? Well? So you don’t think that
knight was a bad man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” she said wearily. “Good,
bad ... what does it all mean?”</p>

<p>“You know fine what it all means. You wrote that
play,” a ghost of a smile came into his eyes. “Well
... I suppose ... it’s getting late ...” he sighed
drearily, and then held out his hand.</p>

<p>For a few seconds she stood as if hypnotised, staring
at him. Then in a rush, the waste, the foolishness of
it all swept over her.</p>

<p>“David! David!” she cried convulsively, seizing
his arm. “David! What is it all about? Don’t you
see?... there’s you, here’s me. Plasencia’s up
there where we’ll all soon be having tea and smoking
cigarettes. Oh, it’s a plot! it’s a plot! Don’t be
taken in ... why, it’s mad! You’re not going to
become a <i>priest</i>!” Then her words were stifled by
hysterical gasps.</p>

<p>He took hold firmly of both of her wrists. “Hush,
you wee thing, hush! You’re havering, you know,
just havering. <i>You</i>—Sister Pilar—you’re not going to
try and wreck a vocation! You’d never do that!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
You know fine that there’s nothing so grand as sacrifice—to
offer up youth and love to God. It’s not a sacrifice
if it doesn’t cost us dear. I don’t think, somehow,
that a bread made of wheat would satisfy you and me
long. Remember, my dear, this isn’t everything—there’s
another life. Hush now! Haven’t you a
handkerchief? Here’s mine, then.”</p>

<p>With a wistful smile he watched her wipe her eyes,
and then he said, “Well, I doubt ... I must be going.
The motor will be there. God bless you ... Pilar,”
he looked at her, then turned slowly and walked away
in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>She made as if to run after him, and then, with a
gesture of despair, sank down upon the ground.</p>

<p>Well, it was over. She had shut up Life into a plot,
and there had been a counterplot, the liturgical plot
into which Rome compresses life’s vast psychic stratification;
and, somehow or other, her plot and the
counterplot had become one.</p>

<p>Why had he looked so happy when he arrived—only
yesterday? Was it joy at the thought of so soon
saying his first mass? She would never know. The
dead, plotting through a plot, had silenced him for
ever.</p>

<p>Oh, foolish race of myth-makers! Starving, though
the plain is golden with wheat; though their tent is
pitched between two rivers, dying of thirst; calling
for the sun when it is dark, and for the moon when it
is midday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p class="tb">The sun was setting, and the shadows were growing
long. Some one was coming. It was the Doña, looking,
in the evening light, unusually monumental, and, as
on that September afternoon last year when the
children were clinging round her skirts, symbolic. But
now Teresa knew of what she was the symbol.</p>

<p>She came up to her and laid her hand on her head.
“Come in, my child; it’s getting chilly. I’ve had a
fire lit in your room.”</p>

<p class="larger noindent">Sayonara</p>

<p class="larger right">JOHN PARIS</p>

<p><i>Kimono</i>, Mr. John Paris’s first novel, has proved one of
the most remarkably successful books published since the
war. It has been a “best seller” in England and America;
it has become famous all over the Far East and in Canada
and Australia, besides being translated into several foreign
languages. Its successor—<i>Sayonara</i>—has been eagerly
awaited. The theme is based on the familiar aphorism
that “East is East and West is West,” and that any
attempt to reconcile them usually means disaster. Here
again, as in <i>Kimono</i>, are found the most vivid pictures of
Japan, old and new; Tokyo and its underworld, a powerful
picture of Japanese farm life, and the cruel slavery of the
“Yoshiwara.”</p>

<p>This is the first collection of magazine stories which
Mr. Beresford has published. In “An Author’s Advice,”
which he has written as a foreword, he deals searchingly
with the technique of the modern short story, and shows
how drastically the type of story to-day is dictated by the
editors of the great American magazines.</p>

<p class="larger noindent">The Hat of Destiny</p>

<p class="larger right">Mrs. T. P. O’CONNOR</p>

<p>“The best light novel I ever read. The plot is so original,
the characters so sharply drawn and interesting, the
interest so sustained, and the whole thing so witty and
amusing, that I could not put it down.” So wrote Miss
Gertrude Atherton to the author of <i>The Hat of Destiny</i>.
Oh, that hat! that incomparably fascinating hat, what
dire rivalries it engendered, what domestic tribulations
it sardonically plotted when it arrived in Newport amongst
those cosmopolitan butterflies!</p>

<p class="larger noindent">The Soul of Kol Nikon</p>

<p class="larger right">ELEANOR FARJEON</p>

<p>Is the fantasy of a boy in a Scandinavian village, who
from his birth is treated as a pariah because his mother
declares that he is a Changeling. He himself grows up
under the same belief, and the story, treated in the vein
of folklore, leaves it an open question whether there is
some truth in it, or whether it is the result of public
opinion upon a distorted imagination. The tale is told
with all the poetry, charm, and imaginative insight which
made <i>Martin Pippin in the Apple-Orchard</i> such a wonderful
success.</p>

associated, after two interesting experiments of another
kind, that genial “Thick Ear” shocker, <i>Big Peter</i>, and
that charming and very successful phantasy, <i>Pippin</i>. It
is a study of a boy’s character during several critical
years of its development. The scene is chiefly laid in a
rich northern suburb.</p>

<p class="center">Author of <i>The Owl Taxi</i>, <i>The Deaves Affair</i>, etc.</p>

<p>This is Hulbert Footner’s finest mystery story. It tells
how Pen Broome saved her lover, accused of the brutal
murder of a friend; how she saved him first from the
horde of detectives searching for him in the woods round
Ramshackle House, and then, when his arrest proved
inevitable, how, with indomitable courage and resource,
she forged the chain of evidence which proved him to
have been the victim of a diabolical plot. A charming

<p>The scene of this book is the Sussex Weald, and the
story is concerned with the Durrants, who have for generations
been thatchers. The book opens with the birth of
a second boy, Joseph, a sickly, peculiar lad, considered to
be half-witted. The theme is his struggle against his lot,
his humble station, his crazy body, the mournful demands
of his spirit. When he becomes a man, his clever brain
develops and his worldly progress bewilders his relatives
and neighbours—all of them still refusing to believe that
he is not the fool they have always declared him to be.</p>

<p>Anne Ranger, brought up in a very worldly atmosphere,
finds herself confronted by a most difficult problem and
coerced by her former school friend—Joyce Pleybury,
who has drifted into a bad groove—to take an oath of
secrecy which reacts on Anne’s own life in almost tragic
fashion, shattering her happiness from the very day of
her marriage, and thereafter exposing her like a bird in

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound

1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
